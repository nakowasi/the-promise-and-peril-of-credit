<p class="noindent">
<span class="small1">THIS BOOK CAME ABOUT</span>
 in bouts and breaks over the course of a decade during which I accumulated many intellectual, personal, and material debts. Several institutions subsidized my research trips and leaves from teaching: in 2012&ndash;2013, the John Solomon Guggenheim Foundation; in fall 2012, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton; in spring 2013, the American Academy in Berlin; and, on multiple occasions, the Provost’s Office, MacMillan Center, and Program in Economic History at Yale University. While I made extensive use of digitized rare books, I could not have completed my work without the extraordinary physical repositories on the Yale campus&mdash;the Beinecke Library, Sterling Memorial Library, and Lillian Goldman Law Library&mdash;and their extraordinary librarians, including Susanne Roberts, Kathryn James, and Michael Widener. I also availed myself of the special collections of the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the Municipal Library in Bordeaux, the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin, and many other storehouses of knowledge across Europe. During the Australian winter of 2016, the Toorak/South Yarra Public Library in Melbourne gave me shelter during many a cold afternoon and reminded me of what we stand to lose when we defund public libraries.</p>
<p class="indent">A number of research assistants, many now scholars and writers in their own right, have helped me at various stages to track down, swiftly search through, and translate material in multiple languages: Cornelia Aust, Aner Barzilay, Veronica Aoki Santarosa, Yemile Bucay, Gijs Dielen, Amanda Gregg, Charlotte Kiechel, Annalena Müller, Jesse Sadler, Miriam Salzmann, Maximilian Scholz, and Tijl Vanneste.</p>
<p class="indent">I am especially indebted to the many friends, colleagues, and passing interlocutors who asked questions, offered suggestions, corrected mistakes, replied to my queries, or simply provided food for thought along the way. In 2010 Caroline Walker Bynum responded positively to a talk in which I sketched out this project before I really knew what it was about, and her reaction gave me the confidence to continue my work. Later, she also gave me the benefit of her <span title="x" id="calibre_link-2037"></span>
 insight into a pile of untidy pages. Others were equally generous in reading portions of the manuscript (often in undigested form): Jeremy Adelman, William Caferro, Guillaume Calafat, Giovanni Ceccarelli, Simona Cerutti, Lauren Clay, David Garrioch, Oscar Gelderblom, Lynn Hunt, Ari Joskowicz, Naomi Lamoreaux, Sarah Lipton, Nadia Mantrige, Sarah Maza, Avinoam Naeh, Stefania Pastore, Derek Penslar, Sophia Rosenfeld, Maurice Samuels, Andrew Sartori, Roberto Savelli, Robert Schneider, Silvia Sebastiani, Kenneth Stow, Giacomo Todeschini, and Carl Wennerlind. Maxine Berg and two anonymous reviewers commented on the penultimate version of the book for the press and suggested ways of improving it.</p>
<p class="indent">I also wish to acknowledge the exceptional group of women and academics with whom I have shared work in progress on a few treasured occasions over the past several years: Amanda Claybaugh, Patricia Crain, Diana Fuss, Martha Howell, Heather Love, Sharon Marcus, and Judith Walkowitz. They have asked probing questions, put up with my clunky prose, and inspired me with their writing and their example.</p>
<p class="indent">Segments of the book have appeared in print in earlier incarnations: portions of <a href="#calibre_link-99" class="calibre6">chapters 1</a>
 through <a href="#calibre_link-4" class="calibre6">3</a>
 were published in the <em class="calibre4">Journal of Modern History</em>
 (2011) and <em class="calibre4">Archives Juives</em>
 (2015), sections of <a href="#calibre_link-30" class="calibre6">chapter 4</a>
 in <em class="calibre4">Law and History Review</em>
 (2015) and <em class="calibre4">Tijdschrift voor Rechtsgeschiedenis / Revue d’histoire du droit / Legal History Review</em>
 (2015), and a version of <a href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre6">chapter 6</a>
 in <em class="calibre4">French Historical Studies</em>
 (2016). The readers and editors for those articles improved the project when I most needed advice.</p>
<p class="indent">At Princeton University Press, Brigitta van Rheinberg and her staff, including her former assistant Amanda Peery, executive editor and editorial director for the humanities Eric Crahan, and senior production editor Leslie Grundfest, were a dream team. Sarah Vogelsong worked tirelessly to copyedit the manuscript, and David Luljak compiled the index. Their kindess and professionalism made all the difference. Brett Savage, academic assistant in the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, lent me his sharp eye while I was reviewing the proofs. Naturally, all errors are mine.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, I owe more to Carolyn Dean than to anyone else.</p>

 <span class="small">PREFACE</span>
</h2>
<p class="noindent">
<span class="small1">IT WOULD BE MISLEADING</span>
 to say that this book “found me.” But the impetus behind it came as much from what was happening around me as from my academic interests. In September 2008 an endless stream of breaking news relayed bleaker and bleaker economic reports on the future of millions of ordinary people. Lehman Brothers collapsed. Home foreclosures became a daily event. Talk of greed resurfaced in public conversation. Even <em class="calibre4">usury</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">usurious</em>
 , words that I had not heard uttered outside of the classroom, reentered everyday vocabulary, alongside <em class="calibre4">loan shark</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">pawnbroker</em>
 . As financial mogul John Alfred Paulson admitted in April 2010, “We believed that the two-year adjustable rate mortgages made to lower income borrowers with poor credit history, little or no documentation, no downpayment and rates that would shortly reset at <em class="calibre4">usurious</em>
 interest rates set the stage for significant delinquencies and foreclosures, thus eroding the value of these securities.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-492" href="#calibre_link-1358" class="calibre6">1</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">As a citizen, I was angry and anguished. As a historian of early modern European market organization and market culture, I was intrigued and felt slightly vindicated. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, scholarly interest in the slow-paced economies of the preindustrial period had waned, and faith in the upward trajectory of modern financial capitalism had become nearly gospel. Now, it seemed, we were back to square one. No easy solution was in sight. In fact, the daily reports did not seem much clearer than seventeenth-century merchant manuals, which were filled with advice on how to make money as well as warnings against avarice and shady dealers.</p>
<p class="indent">While the global financial system stood on the brink of collapse after years of speculative frenzy, an old excerpt from Warren Buffett’s 2002 annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders resurfaced and went viral. Sounding like Cassandra amid a cheerful crowd of Wall Street investors, Buffett had described credit default swaps as “financial weapons of mass destruction” carrying “dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-493" href="#calibre_link-1359" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
 The statement remains controversial. Not everyone agrees with Buffett’s judgment, and this <span title="xii" id="calibre_link-1785"></span>
 skepticism affects the work of government and private agencies charged with regulating the industry to this day. What is remarkable about Buffett’s warning is that the man who offered it was not a fierce opponent of corporate finance or a future leader of the Occupy Wall Street movement, but the richest man in the world at the time of its writing.</p>
<p class="indent">I mention these recent events not to suggest that we can link today’s rapid “financialization” to earlier transformations of Europe’s economy in simple terms, but to point out that even those who believe in the positive effects of expanding private and public credit, now as in the past, cannot easily agree on where to draw the boundaries of that expansion and what kind of oversight might best prevent fraud and the emergence of oligopolies. <em class="calibre4">The Promise and Peril of Credit</em>
 examines key episodes in the West’s millennium-long struggle to delineate the place that finance ought to occupy in the social and political order. It does so by introducing readers to modes of thinking about the morality of credit that have become increasingly alien to us even as the questions that animated those early modern discussions remain as vital now as they were then.</p>
<p class="indent">After decades of retreat from the mainstream, economic history is making its way back to college curricula and scholarly publications. Today as always, present concerns stimulate academics’ choice of subject matter and approaches to historical inquiry. Income and wealth inequality, the connection between slavery and capitalist modes of production and consumption, the impact of cultural traditions on economic performance, and the timing and consequences of globalization top the list of current research topics pursued by economic historians of various persuasions. A sense of urgency infuses this research&mdash;a welcome and energizing change after decades during which North American history departments’ interest in economic history lay dormant. However, one should not forget that each of these themes has its own long and distinguished scholarly pedigree; nor should we risk falling into the old trap of searching for the origins of contemporary phenomena&mdash;Marc Bloch’s “idol.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-494" href="#calibre_link-1360" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
 While I readily admit, and indeed embrace, the influence that present concerns exert on my scholarly work, my aim in this book is to bring back to life ways of thinking about the economy that have become increasingly foreign to the mainstream of the academy and to interrogate the sources of our amnesia about topics and problems that not long ago occupied a central place in debates about the development of European capitalism.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-495" href="#calibre_link-1361" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In Anglophone historiography in particular, the demotion of the preindustrial period to second-rank importance in examinations of Europe’s economic takeoff has often been compounded by the enduring legacy of the Protestant <span title="xiii" id="calibre_link-1769"></span>
 Black Legend, according to which Catholic societies after the Reformation eschewed profit and indulged in idleness. This twin tendency has affected even serious scholarship and detracted from the study of economic transformations in Catholic Europe from the medieval commercial revolution to the industrial revolution. To be sure, one can always find staunch enemies of all forms of commercialization among Catholic authors, but more interesting&mdash;and, by the sixteenth century, often more influential&mdash;were those theologians, lawyers, judges, philosophers, statesmen, merchants turned writers, and polymaths who did not oppose financial dealings as such but disagreed on the written and unwritten rules that ought to govern the marketplace for the benefit of Christian and polite commercial society.</p>
<p class="indent">Credit was central to those intellectual debates. Derived from the Latin verb <em class="calibre4">credere</em>
 , “to believe” and “to trust,” the noun <em class="calibre4">credit</em>
 and its cognates during this period had economic, legal, political, social, and cultural connotations. Used less frequently, <em class="calibre4">finance</em>
 referred primarily to government finances. The more capacious and common <em class="calibre4">commerce</em>
 was adopted by early modern commentators not only in reference to the activities of retail and wholesale merchants, but also to describe the economic policies governing those activities. But <em class="calibre4">commerce</em>
 had even wider meanings that transcended the economic realm. In the Italian city-states of the fifteenth century, the Latin word <em class="calibre4">commercium</em>
 denoted the material transactions conducted for the purpose of earthly gain and gratification, but it was used just as often in reference to the relationship between believers and the divine, the exchange of ideas among humanists, the social bonds linking all humans (or at least those men who saw each other as peers), and even prostitution (carnal commerce). Although the word <em class="calibre4">commerce</em>
 had a somewhat narrower meaning by the eighteenth century, it continued to be applied to the entire gamut of human activities and beliefs. It follows that technical disquisitions about credit instruments, and what might make them go astray, were never abstracted from moral, political, and social considerations.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus framed, the subject of my inquiry would be boundless, since the search for a well-tempered commercial society was at the heart of too many consequential intellectual and political projects in preindustrial Europe to be examined in any depth in a single study. In this book, I turn to one little-known but revealing chapter in these heated debates about the morality of credit: a narrative that for a good 250 years, from the mid-seventeenth to the early twentieth century, attributed to medieval Jews the invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange, two key instruments of European private finance. There is no truth to this tale, since both financial tools emerged slowly out of previous <span title="xiv" id="calibre_link-1770"></span>
 arrangements, and Jews had no special role in the process, yet it proved surprisingly resilient&mdash;which is why I believe it warrants the designation of <em class="calibre4">legend</em>
 . Over time, this unfounded and today largely forgotten origin story punctuated many and varied literatures about commerce. By working with and around this narrative about Jews and credit, I discuss how numerous Christian authors&mdash;some famous, some fallen into oblivion&mdash;articulated their vision for a morally acceptable and productive commercial society.</p>
<p class="indent">I take representations of Jews’ economic roles to be symptomatic of larger claims: implicitly or explicitly, they conveyed hard-to-define ideals of a Christian-inflected marketplace rather than describing the actual involvement of Jews in the economy. This approach has been adopted almost exclusively in reference to the Middle Ages because of the widely held assumption that in the mid-seventeenth century, the “science of commerce” began to shed its religious concerns about merchants’ moral integrity.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-496" href="#calibre_link-1362" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
 Here, I show instead that late medieval representations of Jews and their alleged modes of handling credit, recast in new guises at various junctions, continued to be central to the definition of European commercial society through the French Revolution and that the founders of modern social thought&mdash;Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Werner Sombart&mdash;incorporated these representations of medieval Jews’ economic roles into their grand narratives.</p>
<p class="indent">In the pages that follow, readers will encounter familiar names and famous moments in European history, such as those I just mentioned, but will also be introduced to a host of unknown figures and unpredictable connections across themes and periods. In trying to make sense of fragments of the past that our blind spots have led us to neglect, I weave together strains of scholarship that have been growing further and further apart. That is why this book does not fall squarely into any single field of historical inquiry but is rather an exercise in demonstrating the potential (and, no doubt, the pitfalls) of roaming across times and places, blending economic and religious history, approaching the history of economic thought from new angles, and integrating Jewish history more fully into the narrative of Europe’s past.</p>
<p class="indent">In piecing together the traces left by the legend that attributed to medieval Jews a foundational role in the creation of modern private finance, my ultimate aim is to demonstrate that throughout European history, debates about the market’s reach have been inseparable from the construction of legal and symbolic hierarchies of inclusion and exclusion. The impersonality of the market is a recent ideal and remains an elusive reality.</p>

 bills of exchange are or how they worked. But from the sixteenth through much of the nineteenth century, bills of exchange were ubiquitous across Europe. Around 1615, an English traveler visiting Venice counseled those interested in following his itinerary on how to obtain ready cash in local currency: “Returne thy money in England by bill of exchange that thou maiest receive it againe in Venice.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-497" href="#calibre_link-1963" class="calibre6">1</a>

 So many used these bills as remittances that they soon acquired metaphorical meanings. An Anglican preacher, for example, declared, “Our prayers are our bills of exchange; and they are allowed in Heaven, when they come from pious and humble hearts: But if wee bee broken in our religion, and bankrouts of grace, God will protest our bills, hee will not bee wonne with our prayers.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-498" href="#calibre_link-1964" class="calibre6">2</a>

 A century later, in the mid-eighteenth century, this system of payment fueled the darkest side of the booming Atlantic trade: the majority of slave cargoes in the British Caribbean were sold for bills of exchange redeemable in London.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">Credit default swaps, an innovation of the 1990s and the target of Buffett’s censure, are only the latest creation of financial engineering, developed in order to facilitate both risk management and speculation. The rate of innovation in the financial sector of preindustrial Europe was slower than that seen today, but not imperceptible. Between 1250 and 1650, bills of exchange introduced considerable novelties, which is why they once were a venerable topic in economic and legal history. In those centuries, they boosted long-distance trade and international finance, and they remained the lifeblood of European and colonial commerce even after corporate stocks began to be sold in Amsterdam and London in the early seventeenth century. During the period of their use, bills of exchange garnered considerable attention among enthusiasts and critics alike, not only for their ability to move and generate wealth <span title="2" id="calibre_link-1753"></span>
 in seemingly mysterious ways, but also for their potential to trick naïve investors. As such, they epitomized the promise and the peril of early modern commercial credit.</p>
<p class="indent">What was so admirable and yet controversial about bills of exchange? Almost everything, especially in the eyes of the inexperienced. Materially, these bills (from the Latin word for “letter,” <em class="calibre4">bulla</em>
 ) were slips of paper, smaller than today’s personal checks, on which someone who was legally or socially recognized as a merchant scribbled a few coded words before adding his (or, more rarely, her) signature. With these coded words, he ordered his agent to pay a specified amount, in a set currency and at a set date, to a third party. The original and principal function of bills of exchange was to transfer funds to distant locations where they could be redeemed in local currency and thus used to purchase goods or pay down a debt. They offered merchants a safe alternative to the transport of minted coins, protecting their wealth from pirates, corrupt customs guards, storms, and landslides. Over time, bills of exchange also came to be used for purely speculative purposes. Experienced and savvy bankers could buy and sell these instruments without any intent of acquiring merchandise but merely to profit from fluctuating currency exchange rates. In this respect they signaled private finance’s incipient autonomy from commodity trade.</p>
<p class="indent">Bills of exchange were the invisible currency of early modern Europe’s “international republic of money.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-500" href="#calibre_link-1966" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
 No formal membership was needed to join this commonwealth, which was made up of merchants who cooperated and competed with one another, spoke different languages, and hailed from different regions. A mixture of informal oversight and legal sanctions held this commonwealth together, and after the sixteenth century its boundaries expanded in conjunction with Europe’s first period of sustained economic growth since the Black Death and the aggressive overseas expansion that accompanied it. What assured the circulation of bills of exchange among the members of this amorphous republic of money, as an eighteenth-century jurist noted, was “a merchant’s reputation, the extent and solidity of his business, the wisdom of the banker ensuring the creditworthiness of those letters.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-501" href="#calibre_link-1967" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
 Given how little public information about the assets of private merchants was then available, anyone engaging in transactions involving these bills depended first and foremost on channels of epistolary communication, occasional informers, relatives, and distant friends. A commercial bank chartered in Vienna in 1787 demanded that Greek merchants provide three sound trading houses as guarantors <span title="3" id="calibre_link-1754"></span>
 if they wished to cash a second bill of exchange&mdash;a measure of the bank’s difficulty in ascertaining the solvency of its clients.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-502" href="#calibre_link-1968" class="calibre6">6</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">By the time their invention was attributed to Jews, bills of exchange were frequently endorsed and passed on from one holder to another. Consequently, they were often confused with money. However, unlike commodity money or minted coins, bills of exchange had no intrinsic value. Unlike paper money designated as legal tender (whether backed by precious metals or land or, more rarely in the early modern period, issued as fiat money), they were secured not by sovereign authorities but solely by the individuals who signed them. While a state that accepts paper money as a form of tax payment can oblige taxpayers to use that same paper money in their private transactions, the circulation of bills of exchange was entirely voluntary, and a merchant retained the right to refuse to pay a bill drawn on his name.</p>
<p class="indent">Naturally, bills of exchange had multiple connections to public finance. State agents, such as tax collectors or army suppliers, used them regularly to move funds from one region to another. More importantly, variations in currency exchange rates depended on the bullion reserves in the region, which in turn depended to a significant extent on a state’s monetary and trade policy (although private merchants themselves sometimes moved bullion from one location to another in order to alter exchange rates). But unlike state bonds, annuities, and the stocks that financed chartered corporations, bills of exchange were primarily an instrument of private finance, and to study them challenges the conventional nexus drawn by historians between money and sovereignty.</p>
<p class="indent">The usefulness of bills of exchange was matched only by their opacity. This combination ensured that they came to symbolize what was most appealing and most anxiety generating about private credit. By moving funds in invisible ways across mountains and oceans, bills of exchange functioned as the lubricant of the “reciprocal commerce” celebrated by many Enlightenment thinkers. At the same time, the lack of transparency with which they fulfilled their functions caused many to worry that cliques of traders possessed undue advantages over others. Moreover, by abstracting value from any tangible referent, bills of exchange amplified widespread fears about social disintegration and the erosion of traditional hierarchies that accompanied the expansion of commerce.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, bills of exchange represented the ability of merchants to regulate their own activity. Adam Smith regarded this self-regulation as beneficial <span title="4" id="calibre_link-1680"></span>
 to society at large, but he was neither the first nor the last to address the topic. This book examines some of the strongest reactions that bills of exchange, as emblems of merchants’ self-regulation, generated among the learned public. It focuses on the metaphorical associations between these bills and Jews because this connection was frequently drawn in expressions of suspicion about the growing expansion and autonomy of private finance in early modern Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">Starting in the mid-seventeenth century, a number of authors, first in France and then across Europe, maintained that those Jews who had been expelled from the kingdom of France at various points in time between the seventh and fourteenth centuries had devised bills of exchange in order to evade the confiscation of their properties and to smuggle their wealth abroad. The guile of Jews and the resourcefulness of fugitives in general were the two lessons most commonly extracted from this narrative. From Old Regime France, the legend attributing to medieval Jews the invention of bills of exchange spread widely, with echoes heard as far as Brazil and Russia. Subsequently it was resurrected in the nineteenth century, when it informed some of the most influential narratives about the so-called Rise of the West and provoked harsh reactions among scholars of the Middle Ages during the interwar period.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, one is hard-pressed to find anyone who recognizes the existence (let alone deciphers the meaning) of this tale of origins, both within and beyond academia. I know of only one recent attempt to interrogate its significance: an article published in Hebrew in 2004 by Benjamin Arbel. The article’s chief goal is to set the record straight and dispel any residual claim that Jews possessed superior financial prowess, although in the process Arbel unearths important and little-known facts about Jews’ handling of bills of exchange in the sixteenth-century Mediterranean.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-503" href="#calibre_link-1969" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">My goal is different. Of course, I stress the lack of any empirical basis for the legend that pointed to Jews as the originators of European financial development. I insist, however, on treating the legend for what it is: a legend. I reconstruct the aspirations and collective fears of those who invoked it, the reasoning of those who contested it, and the agenda of those who reassembled its moving parts into ever more variations on a theme. In so doing, I map changing and conflicting attitudes toward commercial credit and discuss why Jews, who in the legend are figments of the Christian imagination, provided a broad spectrum of tropes through which those attitudes could be articulated.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="5" id="calibre_link-1808"></span>
 The legend today is so mystifying that I have felt the need to unpack all its constitutive elements in considerable detail and to recount just how many forms it took and how many authors contended with it. The result is the long journey from the Middle Ages through the twentieth century traced in the coming pages. My larger ambition, put succinctly, is to show the heuristic value of Christian representations of Jewish economic roles for probing long-held narratives about the power and limits of the market to create more equal societies. I am not concerned with the question of whether or not Jews ever had a putatively special relationship with capitalism&mdash;a question that, incidentally, I do not believe can be treated separately from its intellectual genealogy. Nor do I posit that in early modern Europe it was impossible to talk about credit without talking about Jews. That would simply not be true. Rather, I draw attention to one consistent assumption that ran through different European cultures from the fourteenth to the twentieth centuries: the idea that Jews were nowhere and everywhere. This idea is at the heart of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">The theme of Jewish invisibility took different forms across time and space depending on the models of interaction with the majority-Christian society to which Jews were subjected: forced conversion, acculturation, or legal equality. After the mass conversions that followed the pogroms perpetrated in Spain in 1391, the difficulty of distinguishing Jewish converts to Catholicism from the rest of the population became the focus of ecclesiastical and secular efforts, which culminated in the “purity of blood” statutes (1448) and the establishment of a modern Inquisition (1478).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-504" href="#calibre_link-1970" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
 The decrees ordering the expulsion or forced conversion of Jews in Castile and Aragon (1492), Portugal (1497), and Navarre (1498) escalated the paranoia that surrounded these presumed “crypto-Jews.” The legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange was born in the one region of Europe other than Iberia where, after the mid-sixteenth century, crypto-Judaism was a de facto reality: the southwest of France. There, Iberian refugees were welcomed as “Portuguese merchants” and, until 1723, were prohibited from practicing Judaism in the open but always suspected of doing so in secret. These so-called New Christians, the wealthiest of whom were concentrated in professions connected with maritime and regional trade, were treated as invisible Jews: their inner religious convictions (whatever they were) had to conform to the outward practice of Catholicism, but their allegiance to Catholicism and to the kingdom of France was constantly doubted; Jews were nowhere to be seen, but their financial power was assumed to be everywhere.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="6" id="calibre_link-1706"></span>
 The invisibility of Jews in those port cities of western and Mediterranean Europe where Iberian converts were allowed to make a home as Jews after the late sixteenth century&mdash;notably Venice, Livorno, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and, later on, London&mdash;was of a different sort. It was neither theological nor complete but the result of a long process of acculturation and deliberate efforts to integrate this group into the fabric of commercial society. In those areas of Europe, Sephardic merchants acquired unprecedented contractual equality in the commercial sphere at the very same time that all merchants who were involved in long-distance trade largely abandoned guilds. The weakness of corporate organizations within the upper echelons of private international trade together with ad hoc policies designed to attract New Christian refugees with fortunes and trading connections meant that Sephardic merchants could now join the international republic of money in ways that they had not been able to do before. They could now enter into contracts with anyone of their choosing, uphold their property rights before secular courts, and even buy state bonds&mdash;a privilege that came with financial and symbolic benefits that had earlier been denied to Jewish bankers in medieval Italian city-states with a public debt.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-505" href="#calibre_link-1971" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In many other respects, Sephardim continued to endure restrictive legal measures and to serve as the targets of scorn and mistrust. But their newly acquired economic privileges put pressure on existing corporate structures and engendered changes that extended well beyond the economic sphere. In both southern and northern Europe, Sephardic Jews cultivated the collective self-image of a respectable merchant community, subordinated some of their religious norms to the demands of commerce with non-Jews, and drew sharp lines between themselves and other Jewish groups that more visibly conformed to Christian stereotypes. Acculturated by choice or by necessity, these postexpulsion communities of New Christians and New Jews, small as they were, were prized for their commercial skills, better liked than their Ashkenazi brethren (because they were more in tune with the local customs), and yet still not fully trusted to play by the rules of Christian commerical society. As a result, they represented both the progress and the dangers of market exchanges that increasingly transcended the traditional hierarchies of clearly demarcated corporate entities.</p>
<p class="indent">After the French Revolution granted Jewish men citizenship rights, making them legally indistinguishable from their peers, Jews’ invisibility assumed yet another guise&mdash;and the most paradoxical to date. Assimilation bred new fears <span title="7" id="calibre_link-1713"></span>
 of Jewish separatism. Indistinguishable from the broader polity but supposedly clannish, Jews were now seen as willing and able to undermine the nation from within in ways that were particularly difficult to unmask. This view soon became the mantra of conservative thinkers, but it appeared with different intensities across a large spectrum of authors and framed the legend’s postemancipation meanings. In Old Regime corporate societies, the fears caused by the emergence of an increasingly impersonal commercial world could be pinned on a group that was highly acculturated but still legally and socially distinct from the dominant one. (Marriages between Jews and Christians, for example, required the conversion of one or the other spouse.) Later, in the postemancipation regimes’ atmosphere of aspiring universalism, those who did not trust the invisible hand to control misbehavior could resurrect ancient tropes and identify Jews as the obscure force behind economic abuse and corruption. During the democratic age, a new essentialism regarding Jews’ collective traits took shape, which, like so-called scientific racism, hardened those hierarchies that legal equality had sought to soften.</p>
<p class="indent">The legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange emerged and evolved as part of the collective suspicion produced by forced baptism, acculturation, and assimilation&mdash;three very different phenomena, but all accompanied by apprehensions about moral contagion and the subversion of the established order. Throughout this book, I will illustrate how easily the anxieties created by Jews’ potential invisibility in the marketplace could be mapped onto the increasing abstraction of the paper economy. The legend’s myriad threads, in other words, bring to the fore the misgivings that went hand in hand with the rise of capitalism and formal equality as pillars of European modernity.</p>
<p class="centerline">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="noindent">Turning from topic to approach, I wish to single out three broad historiographical debates on which my analysis impinges. The first is the question of what constitutes “the economy” as a field of inquiry and what is included in the canon we use to access this field, a concern that has become particularly relevant in light of the impact of the digital revolution on the study of Europe’s past. The second is the relationship between what we might call “practices” and “representations” and the tendency some scholars have had to pit the two against each other. Finally, the third is the perennial question of periodization, which Jewish history and Christian prejudice toward Jews bring into sharp <span title="8" id="calibre_link-1771"></span>
 relief, especially when, as I do, we examine a singular but mutable figure, the Jewish usurer, across several historical periods. The next three sections expand on each of these problems.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2040">The <em class="calibre2">Ars Mercatoria</em>
 : Sources and Canons</h3>
<p class="noindent">I first encountered what I later started to call the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange while rereading Jacques Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 (1675), the single most influential merchant manual of early modern Europe. I was looking for something else, but a chapter on the origins of bills of exchange caught my attention. It stated that Jews expelled from France between the years 640 and 1316 had invented these bills as a way of sheltering their assets when fleeing the kingdom.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-506" href="#calibre_link-1972" class="calibre6">10</a>
</sup>
 I was surprised. The story was riveting, and in spite of many years spent reading about commerce and Jews, I had never heard of it. <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 was a blockbuster, so influential and rich in information that it is difficult to imagine an economic historian of preindustrial Europe without at least a cursory knowledge of it. So why had I never heard of this story? Arguably, economic historians ignored it because it was unfounded, while Jewish historians, who might have noticed it, were unlikely to peruse such a source.</p>
<p class="indent">Since I was sitting near a computer linked to my university’s library system, I typed a few keywords into an online database, <em class="calibre4">The Making of the Modern World</em>
 , to see if I could find other mentions of the story and, ideally, its provenance. It did not take long at all before I identified a title I was not familiar with and that, it turned out, none of the colleagues I consulted knew either: Étienne Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes</em>
 , a compilation of maritime laws accompanied by extensive commentary printed in Bordeaux in 1647.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-507" href="#calibre_link-1973" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
 The first steps of my research went quickly. It took much longer to reconstruct the genealogy of what I now describe as a legend and to unravel its meanings and ramifications.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1977, Albert Hirschman opened his <em class="calibre4">The Passions and the Interests</em>
 , a brilliant work that is critically important for my purposes, by noting that during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, “with the ‘disciplines’ of economics and political science not yet in existence at the time, there were no interdisciplinary boundaries to cross.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-508" href="#calibre_link-1974" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
 This observation captures not only the spirit of its author, impatient as Hirschman was with all disciplinary strictures, but also the amorphous nature of the sources on which my investigation is based. Today a number of electronic repositories of printed material from early modern <span title="9" id="calibre_link-1697"></span>
 Europe permit us to re-create the vastness of the archives that Hirschman had in mind and to mine them beyond the key texts he sampled in support of his influential account of the emergence of the idea that commerce promoted proto-democratic political regimes.</p>
<p class="indent">My book is proof that digital libraries can serve as a powerful corrective to anachronism insofar as they broaden the canon of texts and authors that we can scrutinize. Countless scholars before me undoubtedly read the chapter in Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 that ascribes to medieval French Jews the invention of bills of exchange. Savary cites no source for this narrative. Short of monstrous erudition or a stroke of good luck, how could anyone trace the roots of his account or its evolution over time? It is thanks to <em class="calibre4">The Making of the Modern World</em>
 that I was able to bring Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 , a work that few today have heard of, back into the fold of the writings on all things relating to commerce and the economy, or <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 , where it once held pride of place. Inquiries about the boundaries of the canon are certainly not new; traditional bibliographical and reading methods have already yielded consequential insights, and I am hardly the first to rely on digital libraries.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-509" href="#calibre_link-1888" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
 But digital collections and their potential grow by the day, and they have been used less in European economic history than in other fields (see <a href="#calibre_link-68" class="calibre6">appendix 1</a>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">There are, of course, serious limits to the productive disturbance that data-mining tools can produce. In the case of <em class="calibre4">The Making of the Modern World</em>
 , the exclusion of manuscript sources, the overrepresentation of English-language texts, and the imperfection of its optical recognition devices caution us against using it as the referential universe for a statistical analysis of the incidence of certain keywords. For this and other reasons, I chose to cast “distant reading” aside&mdash;that is, not to resort to quantitative treatments of published titles but to rely instead on a more conventional combination of close and contextualized reading.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-510" href="#calibre_link-1975" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The availability of digital platforms has nonetheless been critical to my ability to map the legend’s transmission and sketch the larger labyrinth of textual worlds within which it traveled. Since early modern authors (with the exception of biblical and legal scholars) made sparing use of footnotes or other bibliographical reference systems, full-text keyword searches are crucial to identifying chains of intertextuality. Moreover, to speak of a canon is to refer not only to a set of texts and authors, but also to their classification into schools of thought&mdash;in our case, those of mercantilism, anticommercial classical republicanism, <em class="calibre4">doux commerce</em>
 , the Gournay circle, and physiocracy, to cite only the most well-known trends within French economic thought from the late <span title="10" id="calibre_link-1691"></span>
 seventeenth century to the Revolution. Of course, many scholars have challenged the stability of these “schools.” Scans of searchable digital libraries challenge these traditional interpretative frames even more. References to the legend of the Jewish origins of bills of exchange are sometimes the result of intentional borrowings and other times the byproduct of uncritical copying. They cross genres and widely accepted ideological fault lines to the point of blurring those lines.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2041">Images as Practices, Practices as Images</h3>
<p class="noindent">In addition to questions about sources and reading modalities, I was drawn to this project because the study of both commercial credit and Jewish life in premodern Europe defies the traditional division of labor between intellectual and cultural historians, on the one hand, and social and economic historians, on the other. The so-called “history wars” of the last quarter of the twentieth century raised important epistemological questions about the relationship between discourse, power, and social change, but also built high walls between practitioners of different areas of historical inquiry. The chapters that follow constitute my effort to surmount these walls, even as I am all too aware of the reasons why they exist and the difficulty of meshing dissimilar approaches.</p>
<p class="indent">My inquiry began not with any specific interest in the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, but with a puzzle: early modern merchant manuals and dictionaries of trade aimed at legitimizing commerce and laid out the norms that facilitated engagement in commercial transactions beyond close-knit groups, but they were also peppered with stereotypes about certain communities of traders. Why did these stereotypes multiply alongside the effort to broaden the boundaries of European commercial society? What was the meaning of these biases? Did they inform a proto-sociology of merchants, or did they serve a different function? And what accounted for the attributes ascribed to each group? Savary and many other commentators, as we will see, compared Jewish merchants to those from eastern churches, such as Armenians and Greeks, and even to some groups from Central and South Asia. How did these seeds of Orientalism emerge, evolve, and crystallize in European commercial literature, which sometimes contrasted one group with another and other times lumped all of them together as paragons of economic slyness? What impact did these images have on merchants’ strategies? That is, what kind of signals, if any, did labels such as “Jews,” “Greeks,” and “Armenians” send in competitive marketplaces plagued by a scarcity of information about the <span title="11" id="calibre_link-1846"></span>
 creditworthiness of individual actors, especially those coming to town from afar or moving within separate circles?</p>
<p class="indent">A related and complementary set of questions concerns the status and credibility of women. In eighteenth-century Paris, for example, it became easier for aristocratic women to obtain credit in the growing number of shops where the latest fashionable garments were sold, even if in reality they were not always in a position to repay their debts&mdash;an indication that rank remained a pivot of economic reputation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-511" href="#calibre_link-1976" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 Contemporary Enlightenment texts often identified women as avatars of luxury and consumption, whether to condemn the volatility and corruption of commercial society or, by contrast, to exalt its expanding possibilities. There are obvious parallels between women and Jews and their respective positions in credit markets, not least because both groups were deprived of legal equality during the Old Regime. There are also many differences in the access that each group had to credit and to legal recourse, as well as obvious differences in the economic power enjoyed by a variety of Jewish and Christian women. In eighteenth-century France, only women who were members of a guild or merchants’ widows who were “publically known as merchants” could legally sign bills of exchange, but there is evidence that transgressions of this norm occurred. When and how were women able to obtain commercial credit? How did social perception affect their reputation in the sphere of market transactions? Although I am unable to take up these issues in this book, I spell them out because they animate my broader agenda and might provide the impetus for further comparisons of the legal and social purchase of different marginalized groups.</p>
<p class="indent">Cultural constructions of propriety in credit markets do not speak solely to questions of representation but also fulfill regulatory functions, albeit in ways difficult to measure. A merchant’s reputation was the black box of premodern commercial credit. It follows that the reputation of Jewish merchants in Christian Europe, like that of other stigmatized minorities, was normally a product of both documented individual behavior and collective stereotyping. The goal of my analysis is not to calculate the degree to which belief in the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange affected credit relations between individual Jews and non-Jews, but to show that the legend’s intellectual evolution was nourished by and gave voice to preoccupations that were real and tangible. Rightly or wrongly, an individual’s public conduct was usually taken to be a reflection of his or her aptitude and financial standing. But could all individuals control their public image&mdash;or were some seen through a collective lens? Who was subjected to this vetting and when?</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="12" id="calibre_link-1671"></span>
 As a general rule, the greater the uncertainty under which credit relations are established, the more tempting, and arguably sensible, it is for lenders to resort to collective stereotypes in judging potential borrowers. Imperfect as they are in measuring an individual’s competence and rectitude, collective stereotypes in premodern societies reflected the existence of segmented communities, each of which was the object of greater or lesser mistrust and more or less able to monitor its members. The notion that collective stereotyping in credit markets is discriminatory is very recent, both culturally and legally. Even in today’s markets, which are comparatively more open and freer from overt discrimination, actors often resort to what economic sociologists call “status signals” in order to advertise their performance and products.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-512" href="#calibre_link-1977" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">A simple fact is indicative of the legend’s normative function in the commercial sphere: the tale did not first appear in the sermon of a Franciscan friar, an Elizabethan play, an anti-usury tract, or a Christian polemic against the so-called “errors of the Jews”&mdash;all genres that abounded at the time and reveled in antisemitic tropes. Rather, its earliest and principal vehicles were compilations intended to valorize the role of commerce in a feudal society and to offer merchants concrete guidance. Occasionally, we also find mentions of the legend in the everyday documents drafted by French Catholic merchants. A report submitted in 1702 by the Deputies of Commerce, a council of twelve merchants from the kingdom’s major cities charged with advising the crown, asked the king to curb the “abuses” committed by tax farmers and state financiers who surreptitiously exported funds by means of bills of exchange. The report was far from an indictment of bills of exchange as such, but by opening with a recapitulation of their supposed invention by the Jews expelled from France “on account of their usuries,” it arguably appropriated the legend in order to introduce the notion that there were more and less legitimate ways of handling those bills.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-513" href="#calibre_link-1978" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This is a striking example of the fact that we cannot assume that a sort of pragmatic tolerance infused merchant culture. The moralizing and sometimes venomous tone of petitions and didactic literature produced by and/or for merchants had a clear prescriptive value. After all, the parameters of public action that rulers set for different merchant groups responded to the public perception of each of these groups and a generalized distrust of Jews’ loyalty to the state and to society. In the absence of a modern conception of separation between church and state, Jews’ rejection of Christian revelation cast them in the eyes of elites and the uneducated alike as infidels lacking <em class="calibre4">fama</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">fides</em>
 , <span title="13" id="calibre_link-1772"></span>
 that is, public reputation and trustworthiness. For this reason, although the legal status of Jews varied greatly from place to place, nowhere could they hold public office, join craft guilds, or give testimony against Christians in a court of law.</p>
<p class="indent">Negative group stereotypes tend to be remarkably impermeable to reality, even as they possess a striking ability to conjure new meanings out of a finite repertoire. This twin characteristic is a distinctive feature of Christian prejudice against Jews and is apparent in the legend under investigation, which fused medieval clichés about Jewish usury and seventeenth-century exaggerated admiration for Jewish commerce. Jewish lending to Christians in the late Middle Ages was largely confined to pawnbroking for the poor and loans to rulers. Bills of exchange, by contrast, were icons of the early modern paper economy, capable of moving funds across distances in invisible ways, yielding profits with no direct connection to the sale of material goods, and proving susceptible to equally mysterious defaults. In spite of new regulations issued after the sixteenth century by municipal, state, and fair authorities, bills of exchange were difficult to monitor, and in the matter of their management, expert merchants somehow always knew better than lawyers, judges, and government officials.</p>
<p class="indent">By pointing to Jews as the inventors of bills of exchange, the legend did not identify any specific type of abuse that was occurring but rather cast suspicion on commercial credit in general by playing into widely shared cultural assumptions about Jews’ unscrupulous dealings. In so doing, the legend became a substitute for hard-to-define normative criteria for the rightful handling of bills of exchange. Its subsequent adaptations, then, recombined different elements of the sketchy historical narrative on which it was grounded for different ends. Some of these accounts were closer to the original version than others, but all grappled with the aspirations and fears generated by the paper credit instruments’ abstraction of wealth from tangible assets.</p>
<p class="indent">In this respect, my approach echoes William Sewell, Jr.’s self-consciously oxymoronic quest to write “a concrete history of social abstraction,” that is, a history of those practices and institutions that created the conditions for more anonymous market exchanges and were thus part of the process by which the market became a metaphor for a democratic political order.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-514" href="#calibre_link-1979" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
 Bills of exchange lend themselves particularly well to this task. As material artifacts, they had no intrinsic value. Their monetary worth was the measure of the credibility assigned to the chains of signatories who backed them, rather than <span title="14" id="calibre_link-1749"></span>
 of any sovereign authority. At the same time, because they had to be physically transported from one place to another in order to be redeemed, their circulation depended on concrete communication infrastructures and was embedded in personal networks of recognition, which relied on epistolary exchanges and other verification systems.</p>
<p class="indent">But I also insist more than Sewell probably would on the asymmetric nature of the exchanges that these abstract credit instruments promoted. His interest in isolating the social practices that underpinned the eruption of egalitarianism during the revolutionary years has led him, in my view, to overestimate the transparency and openness of Parisian coffeehouses and promenades, which he regards as spaces where men and, to an increasing degree, women disguised their legal identities in ways that subverted a cardinal principle of Old Regime hierarchies: status. Recovering Jürgen Habermas’s explicitly neo-Marxist approach (which previous Anglophone appropriations of Habermas had largely eschewed), Sewell overplays the egalitarian ethos of the proto-capitalist classes.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-515" href="#calibre_link-1980" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
 I believe that we ought to take his invitation to locate the material bases of emerging social abstraction and democratic politics seriously, but that we cannot overlook the apprehension that anonymity generated or the lack of fairness that plagued competitive markets of the time.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-516" href="#calibre_link-1981" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Bills of exchange are ideal objects for this type of analysis because they embody the tension that existed between egalitarianism and oligopolies in early modern commercial credit markets. Their diffusion was greeted by praise of their utility but also denunciations of the potential harm they could inflict. Jonathan Sheehan and Dror Warman have recently argued that the South Sea Bubble of 1720 triggered a Europe-wide intellectual and cultural shift that displaced both providentialism and mechanical materialism in favor of the concept of self-organization in many spheres of intellectual inquiry.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-517" href="#calibre_link-1982" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
 There may be an interesting coincidence between the 1720 financial crash and a host of philosophical trends, but in the realm of economic thought, broadly conceived, self-organization had by this time already been recognized as a powerful force. Self-organization is in fact what bills of exchange epitomized and to what the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange responded. Merchants’ autonomy and self-organization were both desirable and unsettling. The legend offered no solution to this conundrum but, in most of its permutations, acted as a warning, because Christian observers agreed that to trade bills of exchange “in the Jewish manner” meant something dangerous and unwelcome.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2042"><span title="15" id="calibre_link-1813" class="calibre1"></span>
 Continuities and Change</h3>
<p class="noindent">Formulated in the mid-seventeenth century as money markets were becoming more and more impersonal, the legend of the Jewish origin of bills of exchange grafted medieval clichés about Jewish pawnbroking onto the early modern reality of new instruments of credit. By the early twentieth century, then, this story became a pseudo-fact in credible academic accounts. This exceedingly long chronology raises questions about the permanence and reconstitution of stereotypes. These questions in turn prompt us to probe the pertinence of labels such as “medieval,” “early modern,” and “modern” for Jewish and European history at large.</p>
<p class="indent">Those scholars of European Jewry who are wedded to a “lachrymose” narrative are also prone to emphasize continuity, in the form of persecution, rather than change (although considerable disagreement exists about whether racialized antisemitism in the second half of the nineteenth century constituted a new phenomenon or a mere evolution of preexisting themes). By contrast, confronted with the variety of manifestations of Jewish life and thought, many historians tend to stress adaptation more or at least as much as discrimination.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-518" href="#calibre_link-1983" class="calibre6">22</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Every inquiry into Christian representations of Jews, however, shows that this contrast is overly simplistic. Prejudice is at once tenacious and protean. It builds on motifs from earlier times that are transmitted through both learned and popular culture and at the same time gives voice to tensions that are locally bound and highly specific. This dual nature of prejudice is fully reflected in the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange. That is also why by the mid-eighteenth century, different characterizations of the economic roles played by Jews began to correspond to larger narratives about continuity and change between what today we refer to as the “medieval” and “early modern” periods in European history. Montesquieu’s <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 (1748) linked the notion of Jews as forerunners of European capitalism to the view of the medieval church as an anticommercial institution and in so doing cast a long shadow over future scholarly endeavors and lay conceptions alike. For the French philosophe, in the Middle Ages Jews dominated commerce because the church demonized commerce and therefore good Christians shunned it. In his view, Jews invented bills of exchange at the time of Europe’s maritime explorations and colonial expansion&mdash;the onset of what today we would call early modernity&mdash;and thus helped inaugurate a new epoch during which the <span title="16" id="calibre_link-1811"></span>
 influence of the church receded and commerce promoted “softer” politics and social mores.</p>
<p class="indent">For generations to come, progressive liberal historians seized upon the caesura that Montesquieu posited between a Catholic obscurantist Middle Ages and a secular early modernity propelled by commerce, and branded it into a standard periodization. Marxist and conservative social theorists also embraced the philosophe’s discontinuity between the Middle Ages and the sixteenth century, albeit with different cultural and political valences. In the interwar period, however, specialists of medieval Europe challenged this paradigmatic chronology by dating the origins of modern European capitalism to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and portraying it as a notable achievement of Christian communal civilization, untainted by Jewish influence. Since the 1970s, the marginalization of the sixteenth century&mdash;the period when bills of exchange gave rise to new forms of financialization&mdash; in the historiography of European economy and economic thought has reintroduced the idea of a sharp break between late medieval and early modern financial institutions.</p>
<p class="indent">Through a different set of reflections, scholars of European Jewry have also come to emphasize discontinuity and now recognize three distinct moments in Christian thought about Jews’ economic roles across the medieval and early modern periods, each with its own temporal and geographical specificities. The first moment, which coincided with the economic boom of Italian city-states and culminated in the norms issued at the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) to regulate the Jewish presence amid Christians, was dominated by writings on usury by moral theologians and canon lawyers. There are two sides to the thirteenth-century conception of usury, which shaped European representations of Jews and credit for centuries to come. On the one hand, Jews were thought to embody the practice of usury. Having denied the divinity of Christ, they were presumed to feel no allegiance to the Christians among whom they lived and whom they cheated at liberty. As proof and consequence of Jews’ theological infidelity, secular rulers assigned to them the function of pawnbrokers and allowed them to charge high interest rates. On the other hand, both religious and lay commentators defined usury (the opposite of charity) as the ultimate antisocial behavior, one that was not a prerogative of Jews. Franciscan friars, in particular, who proved instrumental in devising a Christian ethic for the urban renewal of late medieval Italy, formulated a conception of Jewish usury as a metric against which to measure everyone’s conduct. If Jews were <span title="17" id="calibre_link-1787"></span>
 programmed to exploit Christians, all economically exploitative behavior could be portrayed as metaphorically Jewish.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-519" href="#calibre_link-1984" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">After the mid-sixteenth century, in pockets of Europe there emerged a second discourse, which was also linked to a new set of policies, dubbed “philosemitic mercantilism” by Jonathan Israel.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-520" href="#calibre_link-1985" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 These policies favored greater inclusion for Jews on the grounds that they possessed unique commercial skills that could benefit both the state and society in an age of growing competition between European powers for the control of overseas resources and territories. Although far more inclusive of real-life Jews than their medieval antecedents, seventeenth-century doctrines of toleration inspired by philosemitic mercantilism still regarded Jews as a discrete and potentially oligopolistic group that required ad hoc regulation within a corporate social order. These doctrines left no room for ideals regarding the anonymity of the market and all-around free competition. In Bordeaux, where Cleirac lived and wrote, the French crown implemented policies founded on a peculiar version of these beliefs.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a third discourse on the connection between Jews and the monied economy appeared along the Franco-German border in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. This late Enlightenment discourse is the most familiar to us because it still informs a good portion of modern historiography. It postulates that Jews’ hyperspecialization in commerce was the result of historical circumstances rather than nature. According to this account, since the fall of the Second Temple in 70 CE, centuries of persecution and exclusion from other economic sectors imposed by Christian rulers forced Jews to devote themselves to commerce; in the process, Jews came to excel at it. This discourse has been called a “new paradigm” because, unlike previous ones, it relieved Jews of any blame, condemned their oppressors, assumed the reversibility of Jews’ economic proclivities, and went further than any existing theory of toleration in advocating Jewish civic and political equality.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-521" href="#calibre_link-1986" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are good reasons to stress the differences among these three discourses, including the rejection of a “lachrymose” narrative of fixed enmity against Jews. At the same time, this tripartite scheme errs on the side of discontinuity, eliding the facility with which elements from each of these discourses migrated from one to the other and were recycled in new syntheses. The fusion of the figure of the medieval Jewish pawnbroker with that of the all-powerful early modern Jewish merchant, for example, became complete in France during the last quarter of the eighteenth century in the course of debates about whether or not to grant equal rights to Jewish men. No champion <span title="18" id="calibre_link-1685"></span>
 of the Jewish cause advanced an argument based on Jews’ commercial prowess or heralded as models the highly acculturated Sephardim of Bordeaux, although some scholars today argue that this group’s success provided reformers with the rationale for granting French Jews legal equality. In fact, the process leading to the first emancipation of Jews in Europe reveals that ostensibly positive assessments of Jewish contributions to commerce never rendered medieval images of Jewish usurers obsolete.</p>
<p class="indent">The tripartite scheme that currently dominates scholarship on Christian images of Jews’ economic roles also leaves out an important chapter in the history of early modern European economic thought: sixteenth-century debates on legitimate and illegitimate forms of credit and the role that representations of Jews played in them. Europe’s greatest economic thinkers in the sixteenth century were Scholastic moral theologians who sought to adapt Aristotle’s preference for a natural economy of subsistence to the contemporary growth of international trade. The result was the condemnation of those merchants whose sole purpose was to “fructify” wealth and the valorization of those merchants who redressed the God-given unequal distribution of resource endowments across the planet by carrying goods from one region to another. Contrary to the claims of an older historiography, Scholastic condemnations of usury were rarely generalized, blanket statements, if only because the church was itself involved in financial affairs by its administration of immense landed and movable wealth. Even in the medieval Catholic tradition, the vilification of improper credit practices coexisted alongside positive depictions of respectable merchants, who were often portrayed as upright leaders of civic and political institutions. The early modern period inherited from the thirteenth century not only the difficulty of distinguishing wicked from reputable financial transactions, but also the habit of resorting to images of Jews to draw such distinctions.</p>
<p class="indent">The tenacity of this double construction of usury, with its literal and figurative cogency, not only reinforced the assumption that Jews would always act unfairly in credit markets but also ensured that they became synonyms for self-serving economic practices in general. Ultimately this capacious definition of Jewish usury would be used to police membership in the medieval <em class="calibre4">civitas</em>
 , the eighteenth-century <em class="calibre4">société</em>
 , and the postemancipation nation-state.</p>

<span class="small1">THOUSANDS HAVE READ</span>
 this passage since it first appeared in print in 1647, yet we still do not know what to make of it. The statement is patently false: Jews invented neither marine insurance nor bills of exchange. Nevertheless, for nearly three centuries, it captured the imagination of a great many authors&mdash;some famous and others today regarded as inconsequential but once read widely. My aim in this book is twofold: to demonstrate that this tale of origins was once so well known that it can justly be called a legend and, by understanding its significance and reverberations, to shed new light on Europe’s cultural and intellectual entanglements with economic modernity.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-523" href="#calibre_link-2" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The quotation claiming that Jews invented marine insurance and bills of exchange is lifted from a compilation of maritime laws assembled with commentary by a provincial French lawyer, Étienne Cleirac, published in Bordeaux under the title <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 (<em class="calibre4">Usages and Customs of the Sea</em>
 ). Forgotten as much as the story it relays, this volume, as we will see, was a seventeenth-century publishing success. In this and the next two chapters, I peel back the layers of each historical and textual reference made by Cleirac in the three lines cited above and in the longer segment of commentary&mdash;roughly seven pages of printed text&mdash;to which they belong. In so doing, I unlock the explicit and, even more crucially, implicit meanings that contemporary readers <span title="20" id="calibre_link-1682"></span>
 would have gleaned from this narrative. I begin by describing the characteristics of the two financial instruments that Cleirac invokes, marine insurance and bills of exchange, in order to make clear what his audience would have known about them. <a href="#calibre_link-3" class="calibre6">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a href="#calibre_link-4" class="calibre6">3</a>
 will then review the bewildering assortment of citations that Cleirac weaves into this tale of origins, including his false attribution of it to the medieval Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani (d. 1348).</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac’s prose is undisciplined even by period standards, as the short excerpts included in the next several page indicate (and they are the least meandering in his commentary!). It is for this reason that I parse his words almost one by one. My exegesis will show that out of a hodgepodge of citations, which range from St. Paul to Matthew Paris, from French chroniclers to Jesuit theologians, from Dante to Ariosto and beyond, his consistent preoccupation emerges: how to distinguish good from bad creditors, and good from bad credit instruments, in an increasingly impersonal market. The legend that Cleirac committed to the printed page proved to be a gripping, if inadequate, answer to the thorny problem of where to draw the line between illegitimate and appropriate credit relations, a problem that the commercial revolution of the Middle Ages had raised and the further diffusion of new credit instruments in the sixteenth century had made impossible to avoid.</p>
<p class="indent">My interpretative practice is loosely indebted to symptomatic reading, that is, a reading modality that urges critics to unveil the latent meanings that lie beneath the surface of a text.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-524" href="#calibre_link-5" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
 In so doing, I uncover a powerful discourse that drew from Catholic definitions of usury and adapted them to a seventeenth-century reality in which marine insurance and bills of exchange were widely used. The result, as I will elucidate, had a seductive rhetorical purchase.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2043">Why Marine Insurance and Bills of Exchange?</h3>
<p class="noindent">The passage quoted at the opening of this chapter, which sums up the legend of these financial instruments’ Jewish origins, appears in Cleirac’s commentary on the first article of the <em class="calibre4">Guidon de la mer</em>
 (<em class="calibre4">The Standard of the Sea</em>
 ), a set of maritime rules promulgated in Rouen in the mid-to late sixteenth century and reprinted in <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 . The <em class="calibre4">Guidon</em>
 , as the title of its first article&mdash;“On the contracts or policies of insurance: Their definition, conformity, and differences from other maritime contracts”&mdash;suggests, was devoted to marine insurance. It made no mention of bills of exchange. It was Cleirac who linked the two credit instruments to one another. His argument was historically <span title="21" id="calibre_link-1759"></span>
 baseless but had its own logic: after inventing bills of exchange, he claimed, Jews also had to invent marine insurance in order to protect the value of the assets they had left behind&mdash;value on which they expected their bills of exchange to be drawn.</p>
<p class="indent">Marine insurance and bills of exchange were among the most prized byproducts of the commercial revolution of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which, unlike the industrial revolution that followed half a millennium later, was propelled by institutional more than technological change. They made it easier for investors to conduct their business without leaving their home base and formed the connective tissues of European long-distance trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-525" href="#calibre_link-6" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
 At the same time, both marine insurance and bills of exchange became the objects of intense theological and canonistic debates concerning usury.</p>
<p class="indent">No single person or group invented either of these instruments. Both went through a long period of incubation and incremental evolution, which reached maturity in the sixteenth century.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-526" href="#calibre_link-7" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
 Three trends characterized this formative period in the history of European commercial credit instruments. First, although marine insurance and bills of exchange were designed to facilitate transactions conducted at a distance, considerable variations existed in the local norms that regulated their issuance and use. These variations inevitably generated uncertainty. Second, while marine insurance and bills of exchange became more and more standardized, ordinary, and common over time, they also increased in complexity and sophistication. These developments rendered them opaque in the eyes of the uninitiated. Last, by the early modern period, merchants no longer needed to notarize these (and other) business contracts. In continental Europe, notaries were public officials who charged small fees in return for issuing documents that courts would accept as evidence. Both rich and poor went to notaries to protect their property rights. An exception was made for merchants, who processed too much paperwork to be bothered to notarize each of their obligations, and so their signature appended to a contract styled in conformity with written norms and accepted practices came to suffice as legal proof. After the mid-fourteenth century, bills of exchange, too, ceased to be notarized.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-527" href="#calibre_link-8" class="calibre6">6</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">For our purposes, the latter shift had two important consequences. It granted European merchants an unusually high degree of self-regulation, since no other social group in Roman law countries was equally able to certify its own property rights. Moreover, in the cities of western Europe where Jews were allowed to reside as international merchants rather than as pawnbrokers after the late sixteenth century, Jewish merchants were permitted to forgo <span title="22" id="calibre_link-1834"></span>
 notarization like all other merchants and to bring their papers before Christian tribunals. This legal framework, designed to make access to the market more generalized, eased commercial credit relations between Jews and non-Jews; at the same time, it also blurred the distinction between the two groups in the eyes of those who did not wish to see that distinction undone.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2044">Marine Insurance</h3>
<p class="noindent">Marine insurance contracts grew out of previous risk-sharing contracts, notably sea loans, which had existed in the Mediterranean since antiquity with the dual function of financing overseas trade and reducing its uncertainty.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-528" href="#calibre_link-9" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
 Premium-based insurance was an innovation of the mid-fourteenth century that soon spread from the Italian maritime republics to other regions of Europe. Its principles were analogous to those of today’s insurance. The premium was expressed as a percentage of the declared value of the items that were being insured and generally included the broker’s fees. In case of a legitimate loss, the underwriter owed the insured party the declared value of the items that had been insured. By the time Cleirac composed his commentary, it was possible to insure not only cargo but also the ship and its infrastructure, as well as passengers (in case they fell prey to infidel captors), and even to resell the insurance contract to another underwriter.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-529" href="#calibre_link-10" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">While sea loans were issued against collateral (whether the ship or its cargo), the price of marine insurance was determined by underwriters on account of their knowledge of vessels, captains, routes, wars, piracy, and other elements affecting the likelihood of an accident at sea. Information was thus key to making a profit, but it was unevenly distributed. Although actuarial computation of mortality trends appeared in the seventeenth century, no public statistics were available for calculating insurance premiums. The incremental standardization and professionalization of the purchase, sale, and litigation of marine insurance offered only partial solutions to structural risks.</p>
<p class="indent">Long before Cleirac declared marine insurance a Jewish invention, the terms of most insurance policies were outlined in preprinted forms. In 1524, Florence mandated the adoption of a standard formula and the registration of all policies.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-530" href="#calibre_link-11" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
 After considerable debate over its specifics, a model contract was issued in Antwerp in 1571.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-531" href="#calibre_link-12" class="calibre6">10</a>
</sup>
 In many port cities, licensed bodies of specialized brokers developed alongside courts devoted to adjudicating disputes concerning insurance policies, while statutory norms, treatises, and ordinances on the subject proliferated. A tribunal for lawsuits concerning marine insurance <span title="23" id="calibre_link-1649"></span>
 (<em class="calibre4">Kamer von assurantie en avarij</em>
 , or Chamber of Insurance and Average) was instituted in 1598 by the Amsterdam municipal council and approved by the States of Holland in 1612. Analogous institutions were subsequently created in London (1601), Rotterdam (1614), Marseilles (1669), and Paris (1671).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-532" href="#calibre_link-13" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
 In 1673, France’s finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, proposed the establishment of a chamber of insurance in Bordeaux, where Cleirac resided.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-533" href="#calibre_link-14" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The circulation of printed premium quotations between set locations arguably led to price convergences, and some merchants and ship owners purchased their policies abroad at competitive rates. Modern calculations based on surviving documents suggest that experienced brokers and underwriters knew how to price insurance by the mid-sixteenth century.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-534" href="#calibre_link-15" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
 Expertise, however, varied greatly. Lorraine Daston concludes that “the system for determining the premium . . . relied on a combination of experience, intuition, and conventions,” rather than on actuarial models. Looking at the very text we are examining here, she observes that “nowhere . . . in his comprehensive survey of maritime insurance does Cleirac offer any specific guidelines to pricing.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-535" href="#calibre_link-16" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
 In other words, in the absence of hard facts, an underwriter’s know-how, which was largely a measure of his local connections and access to reliable correspondents abroad, mattered a great deal.</p>
<p class="indent">Conventional as it was, this system elicited concerns about honesty and transparency. Some merchants tried to insure ships they knew had already been lost, hoping the news had not yet reached their underwriters. Some underwriters spread rumors about the capture of valuable vessels in order to induce ship owners to accept higher premiums. As the speculative character of marine insurance increased, overly confident but sometimes ill-informed investors were drawn into the field and lost fortunes, as happened in Bordeaux during the Franco-Dutch War of 1672&ndash;1678.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-536" href="#calibre_link-17" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 In short, even as it became a fixture of overseas trade, marine insurance continued to disquiet observers. While the instrument helpfully distributed risks across individuals and groups, it retained a similarity to gambling and never dispelled the legitimate fear that certain individuals and groups possessed a disproportionate amount of information on the basis of which they could adjust prices.</p>
<p class="indent">Compared to more sober sources, Cleirac’s commentary, full of digressions and hyperbole, may appear to exaggerate this fear, but its rhetorical excess is better understood in the context of contemporary regulatory institutions’ inability to enforce proper conduct. Even in Amsterdam, the seventeenth-century financial capital of Europe and the city that most resembled an open-access commercial society with equal protection for all its participants, worries <span title="24" id="calibre_link-1650"></span>
 that expertise could lead to the emergence of oligopolies surfaced frequently. Until 1772, individual underwriters and brokers dominated the insurance market, while attempts to set up large companies or a centralized office were struck down for fear that they would give rise to serious market manipulation. A guild of insurance brokers was created in 1578, although unlicensed brokers still continued to operate after its appearance. Jewish merchants, who had a significant presence in Amsterdam, were permitted to join the guild only in fixed numbers. In spite of this restriction, some Christian brokers described their Jewish colleagues as either inept or unfair&mdash;two common refrains of anti-Jewish polemics of the time.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-537" href="#calibre_link-18" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
 In contrast to these guild records, however, notarial deeds show Jewish merchants to have been well integrated into an insurance market dominated by Christian underwriters.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-538" href="#calibre_link-19" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
 This discrepancy suggests that even in the most tolerant European city, where Jews enjoyed unparalleled freedom of thought and economic action, they still symbolized dishonest competition.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2045">Bills of Exchange</h3>
<p class="noindent">If marine insurance prompted qualms about abuses and oligopolies, bills of exchange elicited even greater apprehension. Singular instruments in the landscape of premodern finance, bills of exchange functioned simultaneously as credit contracts and as means of currency exchange. Those who used them testified to their intricacies. Writing in the mid-fifteenth century, the Veneto-Dalmatian merchant-writer Benedetto Cotrugli (1416&ndash;1469) noted that it had taken him two years of practice to learn how to use them.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-539" href="#calibre_link-20" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
 In the 1630s, an English merchant of the Levant Company took it upon himself to jot down “the explanation of the mystery of exchange.” His phrasing was perhaps aimed at wooing readers, but since the book was reissued in 1671, 1677, and 1700, there was clearly an audience for such an explication.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-540" href="#calibre_link-21" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
 Even to a jurist as versed in commercial law as Sigismondo Scaccia, bills of exchange appeared to be an “obscure, difficult, and dangerous subject,” something akin to “alchemy.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-541" href="#calibre_link-22" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">By the time Cleirac set out to write his commentary, bills of exchange were no longer a novelty but had become even more complex than marine insurance. As remittances, their primary function was to transfer funds to a distant location while also ensuring that those funds were made available in the desired local currency. Over time, as we shall see, international bankers also used these bills as speculative instruments involving complicated transactions.</p>

 illustrates the flow of money in a classic bill of exchange using a bill issued in Lyon in January 1552 and reproduced in <a href="#calibre_link-24" class="calibre6">figure 1.2</a>
 . A classic bill of exchange was also known as a “four-party bill” because it involved four parties in two locations. In this case, Averardo Salviati of Lyon needed to remit funds to Rinieri Sernigi in Florence for the purchase of some goods or the settling of a debt. Instead of sending a bag of minted coins across the Alps or down the Rhone River and then on to a ship from Marseilles to Livorno, choices that ran the risk of losing the money either at sea or to robbers, Salviati (the deliverer or remitter) purchased a bill of exchange in Lyon marcs from a local banker, Giacomini &amp; Gondi (the takers or drawers), who had close ties to Florence. The bill ordered the takers’ agent in Florence (Niccolò Borgherini, the payer or drawee) to pay a set sum in Florentine currency to Salviati’s agent, Sernigi (the payee or beneficiary).</p>
<p class="indent">All this elaborate information was condensed into a series of cryptic words on a thin slip of paper that resembled a modern personal check (<a href="#calibre_link-24" class="calibre6">figure 1.2</a>
 ). A nineteenth-century commentator called these bills “laconic” texts.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-542" href="#calibre_link-25" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
 To many, they also appeared enigmatic. They all followed a technical vocabulary (much indebted to vernacular Italian) and a standardized format (<a href="#calibre_link-26" class="calibre6">figures 1.3</a>
 and <a href="#calibre_link-27" class="calibre6">1.4</a>
 ). The expression “per questa prima,” for example, meant that this was the first of several copies of the same bill to be issued; each copy was sent via an alternative route to augment the chances that at least one would arrive at its destination, but only one could be cashed. The exchange rate was set at the start of the transaction, even if the payment always occured at a later moment in <span title="26" id="calibre_link-1750"></span>
 time&mdash;in this case, after thirty-four days. Sometimes a bill would indicate that the payment had to occur <em class="calibre4">at usance</em>
 (the English rendering of “ad uso,” from the Italian word for “custom,” <em class="calibre4">usanza</em>
 ), which meant the standard number of days after which a bill came due in each pair of European cities, as reported in printed sheets, commercial newspapers, and merchant manuals.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">The meaning of certain bills’ coded terms could be even more obscure and eluded most people’s understanding. Thus, while the synthetic quality of these instruments enhanced their expediency, their lack of transparency made them seem potentially dangerous weapons in the hands of a coterie of bankers in a position to manipulate them in secretive ways. Moreover, the immaterial quality of these pieces of paper could give the impression that they were devoid of all tangible value. Exacerbating that impression was the fact that by the mid-sixteenth century, merchants rarely deposited a bag of coins when purchasing or paying a bill of exchange. By this time, the banking system had become sufficiently sophisticated to allow merchants to settle their payments via bookkeeping transactions, especially when they engaged in multiple dealings with one another.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-544" href="#calibre_link-29" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
 Thus, in the example, Borgherini paid the bill to Sernigi after receiving a note (<em class="calibre4">avis</em>
 ) from Giacomini &amp; Gondi and cancelled one of the latter’s obligations from his account book without cashing the corresponding value in coin. Even Salviati could make the initial payment to Giacomini &amp; Gondi by a mere stroke of the pen in an account book rather than by depositing a sack of coins.</p>

<p class="indent">In all these respects, bills of exchange were the quintessential instruments of commercial credit. Unlike a pawnshop, a mortgage contract, or even a marine insurance policy, they were backed not by collateral but by the perceived solvency of their signatories. For this reason, merchants were also the only group in French society that could still be imprisoned for debt when no criminal intent had been ascertained. As the contemporary expression <em class="calibre4">contrainte par corps</em>
 implies, their body stood in place of the collateral in commercial credit operations (<a href="#calibre_link-30" class="calibre6">chapter 4</a>
 ). An authoritative French dictionary of 1690 put <span title="28" id="calibre_link-1760"></span>
 the situation plainly: credit in the commercial sphere was extended “on the basis of a merchant’s reputation for <em class="calibre4">probity</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">solvency</em>
 .”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-545" href="#calibre_link-31" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 Probity is a moral trait, solvency a financial condition. Neither implies the other, even if under the best of circumstances the two go hand in hand. Perceptions and hard facts were not easily separable in preindustrial Europe, because verifiable information about borrowers’ solvency was scarce and actuarial models still in their infancy. Imprecise as they were, word of mouth and business letters were the best sources one could rely on to assess a fellow merchant’s financial standing. No less important than an individual’s perceived probity and solvency were his rank (an aristocrat enjoyed higher credibility than a commoner) and religious affiliation (an infidel was less trustworthy than a good Christian).</p>
<p class="indent">Both the absence of pledges in commercial credit and the conflation of economic, legal, and moral credibility are essential to understanding the reactions that bills of exchange provoked among many observers, and the narrative of the putative Jewish invention of these credit instruments more specifically. We will return to these issues over and over in the course of the book. Here it is useful to consider several additional features that made bills of exchange increasingly complex financial tools as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries progressed.</p>
<p class="indent">A bill’s conversion rate was established in the market of origin in advance of the bill’s maturity. Here lay these bills’ speculative quality as well as a common defense against charges of usury. To merchant-bankers who possessed thick webs of knowledgeable agents and correspondents abroad, bills of exchange offered new speculative opportunities. Divorced from the economy of production and commodity trade, bills during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries could be used solely for currency arbitrage, that is, betting on the differential values of one currency over another at any location (<em class="calibre4">agio</em>
 ). <a href="#calibre_link-32" class="calibre6">Figure 1.5</a>
 illustrates the mechanisms of re-exchange, through which, under ideal conditions, a merchant from Bordeaux could make a 10 percent profit on a hypothetical sequence of conversions between the local currency and Amsterdam’s currency.</p>
<p class="indent">Although exchange dealings between early modern European cities became more and more frequent, unpredictable events, such as the sudden breakout of war or the shipwreck of a galleon carrying bullion from the Americas, could alter the money market in ways that left the lender highly exposed. As a result, the profits derived from such dealings varied greatly. In the mid-fifteenth century, re-exchange contracts between Venice, London, and Bruges brokered by the Medici family, who served as Europe’s chief bankers, yielded annual profits <span title="29" id="calibre_link-1851"></span>
 ranging between a loss and 28.8 percent, with a median value of roughly 14 percent, which equaled the commercial rate of interest at the time.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-546" href="#calibre_link-33" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
 But even the most experienced bankers could not expect to reap consistently high profits. The Lyon branch of the Salviati bank, a key protagonist of the sixteenth-century fairs described in the next section, aimed to net a profit of 2.5 percent on most bills and as much as 16 percent on a few others.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-547" href="#calibre_link-34" class="calibre6">26</a>
</sup>
 But its agents also described exchange dealings as “a matter of fortune” (<em class="calibre4">cosa di ventura</em>
 ) for the high degree of uncertainty they involved.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-548" href="#calibre_link-35" class="calibre6">27</a>

<em class="calibre4">Dry exchange</em>
 was the name used for a speculative loan that involved only a fictional currency conversion (<a href="#calibre_link-36" class="calibre6">figure 1.6</a>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-549" href="#calibre_link-37" class="calibre6">28</a>
</sup>
 In 1582 the Florentine writer Bernardo Davanzati explained this name by recourse to a body metaphor. In a healthy commercial society, he reasoned, four-party bills of exchange would act as the veins that fueled the blood (money) of commodity trade, thus working to “universal benefit.” By contrast, bills traded against other bills would dry up the blood from the veins because they could not sustain “the utility of trade” but “only the utility of money.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-550" href="#calibre_link-38" class="calibre6">29</a>
</sup>
 A learned polymath, Davanzati incorporated into his explanation the views of theologians and canon lawyers, who referred to bills of exchange that did not involve the remittance of any funds as “fictitious exchange.” His moralizing tone, infused with nostalgia for the good old days when merchants traded goods rather than paper bills, places <span title="30" id="calibre_link-1686"></span>
 him in a long and illustrious line of commentators, stretching from Aristotle to Adam Smith, who pitted the ethical industriousness of commodity trade against the parasitical profits derived from financial speculation. Of course, metaphors associating money and blood were never too far from images of Jews. In Franciscan sermons, Jewish moneylending was frequently described as sucking the blood of the town, with the town symbolizing the earthly incarnation of the body of Christ and thus the common good of Christian society and institutions.<sup class="calibre7">

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2046">Financial Fairs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Early modern financial fairs witnessed the first major divergence between capital and commodity markets in preindustrial Europe. Davanzati also referred to dry exchange as “bills of Besançon,” after the French city where one of the most renowned of these fairs was held. An innovation of the sixteenth century, financial fairs hosted specialized bankers and designated brokers who devoted themselves exclusively to the negotiation of bills of exchange. The Lyon gathering was the most important of these fairs, and Florentine bankers acquired a dominant position there. To counter their influence, Genoese bankers established rival fairs in Besançon (1535), which later relocated to Piacenza (1579) <span title="31" id="calibre_link-1852"></span>
 and Novi Ligure (1622). Meanwhile, a number of smaller seasonal gatherings of this sort cropped up in various other towns.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-552" href="#calibre_link-40" class="calibre6">31</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Several defining characteristics of these capital markets can help us understand how an informed but distant observer like Cleirac might have perceived them. First, financial fairs were the dominion of big businessmen, who set the calendar and the exchange rates. Although admission to them was not formally restricted, only a small number of operators cycled through them.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-553" href="#calibre_link-41" class="calibre6">32</a>
</sup>
 Davanzati depicted the fairs as assemblies of fifty to sixty men walking around carrying notebooks in which they recorded bills drawn and cashed across Europe and settled on an appropriate currency exchange rate (unsettled balances could be transferred to the next seasonal fair, with four held annually in Lyon).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-554" href="#calibre_link-42" class="calibre6">33</a>
</sup>
 At their peak in the early seventeenth century, the financial fairs in Piacenza hosted some 145 bankers, chiefly from Florence, Lucca, Genoa, and Milan, in any given year.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-555" href="#calibre_link-43" class="calibre6">34</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Second, these international fairs were events during which particularly arcane financial instruments were developed, including a variant of the dry exchange known as <em class="calibre4">pacte de ricorsa</em>
 , which involved multiple transactions, with the parties to a bill at every seasonal gathering rolling over any accrued interest to the next arbitrage operation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-556" href="#calibre_link-44" class="calibre6">35</a>
</sup>
 Third, all transactions were made in money of account (called <em class="calibre4">écu de marc</em>
 or <em class="calibre4">scudo di marche</em>
 in Lyon and Besançon), a virtual currency that did not exist as minted coins but was used for accounting purposes to convert all bills in foreign currencies and settle accounts.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-557" href="#calibre_link-45" class="calibre6">36</a>
</sup>
 Finally, while local authorities had to agree to host financial fairs in their territories and oversaw their tribunals, they largely left the regulation of disputes between participants to the fairs’ organizers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-558" href="#calibre_link-46" class="calibre6">37</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">More than any other sphere of international commerce, the fairs at which bills of exchange were traded thus represented the degree of self-governance enjoyed by an in-group of well-connected merchant-bankers. At the same time, these rarefied capital markets were not entirely self-contained, as stay-at-home investors with varying amounts of disposable wealth and financial literacy, including noblemen with no direct experience in trade, funded some of their operations. A swathe of commentators that extended beyond intransigent moral theologians feared that financial fairs had become sites of what today we would call insider trading and predatory lending. Aristocrats as well as members of the middle classes engaged in such speculation, lured by the prospect of easy profits. When all went well, investors could reap a 12 to 14 percent profit. But nothing was guaranteed. In 1608 a chain of bankruptcies was caused by young men who, hoping to gain independence from their <span title="32" id="calibre_link-1651"></span>
 families, entrusted their savings to agents trading in <em class="calibre4">pactes de ricorsa</em>
 they did not fully understand. Ruined by their misguided speculations, the young men turned to the Venetian Senate and even accused Jews of being involved in the failure of their investments.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-559" href="#calibre_link-47" class="calibre6">38</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The features of bills of exchange summarized so far explain why they enjoyed a mixed reputation. Before the spectacular stock market crash of 1720, which opened the door to cheap print campaigns against the “follies” of financial speculation, they epitomized the alchemical ability to multiply money or, conversely, to dissipate large fortunes. The author of a mid-fifteenth-century manual described exchange operations as “a passing bird which, if not caught as it lights for a moment, will fly away and be gone for ever.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-560" href="#calibre_link-48" class="calibre6">39</a>
</sup>
 Two hundred years later, in a melancholic meditation on the passing of the glories of Italian (and especially his own city’s) trade, the Genoese merchant-writer Giovanni Domenico Peri lamented the ease with which capital was squandered at financial fairs, provoking serious liquidity crises even among rich bankers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-561" href="#calibre_link-49" class="calibre6">40</a>
</sup>
 A staunch defender of the legitimacy of exchange dealings and the similarity of money to any other merchandise, Peri was nonetheless acutely aware of the risks involved in trading bills of exchange. He warned that those risks were growing by the day because a few great merchants had cornered the market and begun selling complex instruments to the unsuspecting managers of women’s or wards’ estates.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-562" href="#calibre_link-50" class="calibre6">41</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alongside financial fairs, two other innovations affected the workings and perception of bills of exchange: their transferability and the practice of discounting. While to most people financial fairs were esoteric markets in which an expert elite operated according to its own rules, these two innovations accelerated the geographical and social diffusion of bills of exchange and made them an everyday presence in the cities and towns of early modern Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The transferability of bills of exchange was first introduced in the late fourteenth century but became more common after the early seventeenth century. In this kind of transaction, a payee could endorse a bill and thus transfer the claim to another individual, who now had the right to collect the debt.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-566" href="#calibre_link-51" class="calibre6">45</a>
</sup>
 <a href="#calibre_link-52" class="calibre6">Figure 1.7</a>
 shows bills that, unlike the one reproduced in <a href="#calibre_link-24" class="calibre6">figure 1.2</a>
 , carried the signatures of multiple endorsers on the back. In principle, endorsements could be repeated indefinitely because any signatory would assume that previous endorsers had done due diligence and assessed the reliability of the other countersigners. In practice, long chains of endorsers were not the norm. The cost of acquiring information on the solvency of previous endorsers was lower in hubs like Amsterdam, which had highly developed information and legal systems.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-567" href="#calibre_link-53" class="calibre6">46</a>
</sup>
 <span title="33" id="calibre_link-1764"></span>
 By contrast, when merchants used bills of exchange to trade between distant regions where they relied on a limited number of correspondents, chains of endorsers were typically shorter.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-568" href="#calibre_link-54" class="calibre6">47</a>

</figure>
<p class="indent">By the early seventeenth century, traders in large commercial hubs could also sell these obligations at a discounted price to a third party in anticipation of their maturity.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-563" href="#calibre_link-55" class="calibre6">42</a>
</sup>
 If a bill’s beneficiary was in urgent need of cash, he could endorse the bill to a banker in exchange for the immediate payment of a lower sum of cash than the bill’s face value. This transaction clashed with usury prohibitions because it guaranteed a profit to the banker, as the jurist Scaccia reminded readers in 1619.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-564" href="#calibre_link-56" class="calibre6">43</a>
</sup>
 But by then, discounting bills of exchange had become <span title="34" id="calibre_link-1652"></span>
 standard practice, and, in some places, public banks had been set up for this purpose. After the creation of the Exchange Bank (<em class="calibre4">Wisselbank</em>
 ) in Amsterdam in 1609, anyone wishing to negotiate or discount bills worth more than 600 guilders (300 guilders after 1700) had to open an account with that bank. Since foreign traders from all over complied with this demand, the <em class="calibre4">Wisselbank</em>
 became a clearinghouse for bills issued across Europe. During liquidity crises, those account holders who were not strapped for cash could speculate by purchasing bills at a discount.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-565" href="#calibre_link-57" class="calibre6">44</a>
</sup>
</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2047">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">By adding bills of exchange to his commentary on marine insurance, Cleirac paired two credit contracts that by the mid-seventeenth century had become indispensable to long-distance trade and were handled by merchants of all sorts. Of the two, marine insurance was the least murky. By this time, as the next chapter explains, this collateralized speculative instrument was no longer considered usurious. Bills of exchange, by contrast, came in different guises, baffled all but a few adepts, and continued to ignite fierce debates over usury. For these reasons, the majority of authors who engaged with Cleirac’s attribution of the invention of both credit instruments to Jews focused primarily on bills of exchange; this is also why marine insurance will recede into the background as the book progresses.</p>
<p class="indent">The ease with which bills of exchange could be passed from one person to another generated the erroneous but indelible impression that they were like paper money. Some eighteenth-century French authors even referred to bills of exchange as <em class="calibre4">papier-monnoye</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-569" href="#calibre_link-58" class="calibre6">48</a>
</sup>
 Aside from the fact that paper money was rare in Europe before 1800, bills of exchange were not backed by land or bullion managed by the state or a central bank.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-570" href="#calibre_link-59" class="calibre6">49</a>
</sup>
 Unlike banknotes, they were not fully negotiable, nor were payers obliged to accept them.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-571" href="#calibre_link-60" class="calibre6">50</a>
</sup>
 Rather, their value was the direct measure of the faith that endorsers placed in one another and could only be redeemed if acquired in good faith. In sum, the guarantor of a bill of exchange was a signatory’s reputation. Today, cashless payments are routine because verification systems have become sufficiently advanced and automated. In the late medieval and early modern periods, behind these enigmatic slips of paper lay a highly personalized, if no longer face-to-face, market in which dense networks of epistolary correspondents marshaled the information necessary to evaluate an endorser’s credibility.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="35" id="calibre_link-1768"></span>
 Such were the mechanics behind the circulation of bills of exchange, but we cannot ignore the perception produced everywhere by the rapid pace at which these bills circulated: the sense that they could be bought and sold by anyone, with little oversight. Indeed, these bills’ social and geographical reach grew rapidly during the mid-sixteenth century. James Steven Rogers describes this development as moving them “from the exotic to the everyday.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-572" href="#calibre_link-61" class="calibre6">51</a>
</sup>
 By the time Cleirac composed his commentary, discounting bills and transferring their assignability were ordinary operations in France.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-573" href="#calibre_link-62" class="calibre6">52</a>
</sup>
 Not only tax collectors but also local traders and members of the urban middle classes used them on a day-to-day basis.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-574" href="#calibre_link-63" class="calibre6">53</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Propelled by Europe’s colonial and commercial expansion, bills of exchange also traveled farther and farther, in the sense that the geographical distance separating the parties involved in any single bill grew considerably. Even in the absence of an institution like the <em class="calibre4">Wisselbank</em>
 , a multiplicity of sources&mdash;oral, written, printed&mdash;helped merchants who might not have known each other to conduct the background checks necessary to endorse a bill. Private business correspondence was essential to this task, which is one of the reasons why it remained a vital tool of long-distance trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-575" href="#calibre_link-64" class="calibre6">54</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">If tight interpersonal networks were the best assurance against fraud, they could also fail colossally. Collusion among speculators could lead to lives being ruined and households dispossessed. Alarmist commentators were proven right more than once in Old Regime France. In 1728, a group of Parisian bankers filed a suit claiming that the signatures on the bills they had purchased had been forged.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-576" href="#calibre_link-65" class="calibre6">55</a>
</sup>
 In the 1760s, when Turgot was the royal official (<em class="calibre4">intendant</em>
 ) charged with overseeing the region of Limoges, which included some of the poorest areas of the kingdom, members of the local population in Angoulême fell prey to a group of investors. When the deceived parties sued in court, panic spread in the city and interest rates shot up.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-577" href="#calibre_link-66" class="calibre6">56</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Regulatory powers proved weak in the face of such financial crimes. For this reason, self-policing by merchants and bankers was essential but naturally raised questions about foxes guarding the henhouse. This is one of the reasons why, no matter how distorted it was, the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange attracted attention: by recourse to the old trope of Jewish deceit, it articulated concerns about the morality of credit that were very real and yet difficult to pin down. By the time Cleirac inked his account of this legend, bills of exchange had become both more prevalent and more elaborate, instruments that laws and tribunals struggled to regulate.</p>

<h2 class="chtitle2">The Making of a Legend</h2>
<p class="noindent">
<span class="small1">AFTER STATING THAT</span>
 “insurance policies and bills of exchange were unknown to ancient Roman jurisprudence and are the posthumous invention of Jews,” Étienne Cleirac continues his commentary on the first article of the <em class="calibre4">Guidon de la mer</em>
 with a long, if fallacious, historical excursus meant to illustrate his point:</p>
<p class="blockquote">When these abominable circumcised were banned from France because of their wrongdoings and their execrable crimes, and their assets were seized, at the time of King <em class="calibre4">Dagobert</em>
 , King <em class="calibre4">Philip Augustus</em>
 , and King <em class="calibre4">Philip the Tall</em>
 , in order to retrieve their commodities and money, which they had consigned to or hidden in the hands of their friends before leaving, necessity taught these malicious men lacking public trust to use secret letters and bills written with few words and little substance, as bills of exchange still are, addressed to those who had received and concealed their stolen goods and given Jews a hand. Jews carried out these tasks by employing travelers and foreign merchants.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-578" href="#calibre_link-188" class="calibre6">1</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="noindent">He resumes the digression later in the same section of the commentary:</p>
<p class="blockquote">The Italian Lombards, witnesses of and actors in this Jewish intrigue, after they retained the models of these letters, learned to use them effectively when in Italy the unhappy sects of Guelfs and Ghibellines, meaning the followers of the Pope and the Emperor, respectively, threatened each other, so to endeavor to supplant one another and put Christianity through great troubles and tumult.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, Cleirac concludes:</p>

<p class="blockquote">. . . it follows that German and Flemish people call all exchange dealers, bankers, dirty usurers, and resellers of whatever background <em class="calibre4">Lombards</em>
 ; and for the same reason the square in which the market for currency exchange and second-hand goods is located in the city of Amsterdam has kept the name of <em class="calibre4">Lombard Square</em>
 until today.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2048">Fact and Fiction</h3>
<p class="noindent">These excerpts encapsulate the gist of the story that Cleirac bequeathed to his many readers and that this chapter and the next seek to elucidate. In brief, we are told that the Jews expelled from France in subsequent waves under the kingdoms of Dagobert (r. 629&ndash;634), Philip Augustus (r. 1180&ndash;1223), and Philip the Tall (r. 1316&ndash;1322) invented marine insurance policies and bills of exchange in order to salvage their assets when fleeing to “Lombardy,” that is, to northern and central Italy. There, Guelfs and Ghibellines, supporters of the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor, respectively, were embroiled in protracted wars for political control and found those inventions to be very useful every time they were expelled from their own city-states. As a result, Italian refugees exported the newly invented financial instruments north of the Alps, the Guelfs mostly to France and the Ghibellines mostly to Germany and Flanders, where bankers and moneylenders were called “Lombards,” a name eventually given to a public square in Amsterdam.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-579" href="#calibre_link-189" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac’s account is an astonishing mix of fact and fiction, a mix that ensured it a long life. The mention of the Merovingian and Capetian kings by name suggests that Cleirac borrowed whatever little knowledge of medieval French Jews he had from the numerous histories of France that circulated in his lifetime, in which the medieval expulsions were the only mentions of Jewish life (even if in most of those histories more attention was given to Philip the Fair’s general ban on Jews in 1306 than to the persecutions enacted by Philip the Tall).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-580" href="#calibre_link-190" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
 The reference to specific French kings seems to have lent credibility to his tale, because scores of later writers repeated those names (and occasionally added others) when reiterating versions of the legend. For their part, medieval chroniclers kept alive the genre of the vitriolic anti-Jewish polemic. Recalling the expulsions from France of 1182 and 1306, a Spanish Franciscan friar in 1674 borrowed the motifs of earlier chronicles when he justified the expropriations ordered by Philip IV, known as “the Fair,” “because he discovered that they [the Jews] owned nearly all of Paris through their usury and that they held as their captives . . . the remainder of the population.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-581" href="#calibre_link-191" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="38" id="calibre_link-1654"></span>
 Like his account of the timing of the Jews’ expulsions from the kingdom of France, Cleirac’s depiction of the role of Italian merchants in disseminating banking and accounting techniques throughout the Low Countries contains a kernel of truth but also distorts essential facts. It portrays Amsterdam (the capital of the world economy in Cleirac’s lifetime) rather than medieval Bruges as the Lombards’ prime destination north of the Alps.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-582" href="#calibre_link-192" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
 Moreover, no place called “Lombard Square” existed in the Dutch city, contrary to what Cleirac states. Rather, a pawnbroking establishment called “Bank of Loan or Lombard” (<em class="calibre4">Bank van lening ofte Lombard</em>
 ) had been in operation in Amsterdam since 1550, and in 1614, in response to complaints about the abuses to which private moneylenders subjected their customers, the city council turned it into the civic equivalent of the <em class="calibre4">Monti di Pietà</em>
 , the Italian pawnshops set up by friars that extended consumer credit to the poor at very low interest rates.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-583" href="#calibre_link-193" class="calibre6">6</a>
</sup>
 Cleirac may have confused this minor Amsterdam establishment with the city’s magnificent stock exchange (<em class="calibre4">Beurs</em>
 ), where after 1611 merchants gathered in a courtyard surrounded by arcades to conduct financial transactions. In fact, although crowded together in a small urban area, each of these spaces&mdash;the commodity marketplace, the municipal pawnshop, and the stock exchange&mdash; was distinct from one another and catered to different clienteles.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether deliberate or the result of unfailingly muddled prose, Cleirac’s merging of these spaces has the effect of tracing a direct line between fourteenth-century Lombards and seventeenth-century Amsterdam, and makes pawnbroking appear contiguous with the most sophisticated forms of financial credit developed during the sixteenth century. The legend, that is, purposefully conflates what today we call the “medieval” and “early modern” periods. This chronological compression is crucial to Cleirac’s rhetorical strategy of making medieval Jewish moneylenders, the object of scorn and prejudice, interchangeable with the international merchant-bankers of the seventeenth century.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2049">Why Jews?</h3>
<p class="noindent">The historical excursus Cleirac lays out for his readers teaches this first lesson: “It follows that bills of exchange and insurance policies are Jewish from birth, both in their invention and denomination.” With expulsion came confiscation, and Cleirac writes that in order to save their assets, Jews consigned “commodities and money . . . in the hands of friends before leaving.” To redeem the value of these goods abroad, they invented bills of exchange. It is the cryptic quality <span title="39" id="calibre_link-1761"></span>
 of these bills, “written with few words and little substance,” that Cleirac emphasizes and that would become a staple of later literature.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-584" href="#calibre_link-194" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">We have seen how the thin slips of paper that constituted bills of exchange encapsulated myriad rights and obligations. This was the advantage of merchant documents: they omitted the lengthy and convoluted formulas used by lawyers and notaries. But the opacity of bills of exchange separated insiders from outsiders in credit markets. In the eyes of Christians, opacity was also a defining trait of Jews, one that blended their religious and economic infidelity and rendered them suspect of in-group maneuvering.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-585" href="#calibre_link-195" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
 Jews seemed as impenetrable to Christians as bills of exchange. They had rejected the divine nature of Christ and continued to follow traditions and rites that Christians found mystifying and irrational. The publication in 1637 of the first explication of Jewish religious rituals for a Christian audience, <em class="calibre4">The History of the Rites, Customes, and Manners of Life, of the Present Jews</em>
 , by the Venetian rabbi Leon Modena, did little to dispel this perception.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-586" href="#calibre_link-196" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
 On the eve of the French Revolution, ardent gentile supporters of equal rights for Jews called for the elimination of Yiddish (sometimes described as a “Tudesco-Hebraico-Rabbinical jargon”), which they regarded as a sign of ignorance but also, wrongly, as the source of endless tricks committed by Jewish moneylenders at the expense of local peasants ignorant of that language.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-587" href="#calibre_link-197" class="calibre6">10</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Once they invented these portentous bills&mdash;a claim that apparently required no further corroboration&mdash;Jews, Cleirac tells us, deployed their superior financial skills to make sure they would not “be deceived on the exchange rate” and would in fact be able “to make a profit.” In his story, Jews and a few fellow Christian moneylenders were the sole repositories of all knowledge concerning both foreign currency conversions and the intrinsic value of metallic coins, including that related to debasement, government revenues on new minting issues (<em class="calibre4">seigniorage</em>
 ), and clipping.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-588" href="#calibre_link-198" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
 Cleirac assumes that Jews possessed the expertise required to tame the volatility of financial markets. A special interest group endowed with a talent for commerce, they were seen as wielding undue advantage over their competitors and thriving by cheating ill-informed customers.</p>
<p class="indent">Accusations of religious infidelity and economic cunning were mutually reinforcing. Cleirac seems to have chosen his words carefully: those he uses in reference to Jews are theologically loaded, even if they had become common parlance by the time of his writing. He tells us that Jews were banned from France “because of their wrongdoings and execrable crimes,” the latter phrase being an expression commonly applied to Jews and heretics.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-589" href="#calibre_link-199" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
 He describes <span title="40" id="calibre_link-1812"></span>
 Jews as “malicious men lacking public trust” and “people without a conscience.” For Cleirac, Jews always stood apart from the world that surrounded them: they felt “mistrust” even toward those who assisted them in their escape, and it was their ability to turn “the risks and dangers of a voyage” into “a gift or a modest price” that assured them a profit. But Jews’ obsession with self-interest, which was a sign of their separateness from Christian society, meant that their financial skills did not contribute to the common good.</p>
<p class="indent">In a later booklet devoted exclusively to bills of exchange (then still a relatively new genre), titled <em class="calibre4">Usance du négoce</em>
 and published a year before his death, Cleirac’s language is even more theologically charged. He labels Jews as “infamous,” that is, as lacking <em class="calibre4">fama</em>
 , public trust or reputation, and thus the quality that one needs to belong to a community.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-590" href="#calibre_link-200" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
 The trade in bills of exchange is said to retain “its original sin, that is, Jewish perfidy.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-591" href="#calibre_link-201" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
 <em class="calibre4">Perfidia</em>
 is a keyword that would have hit its mark at the time. A Latin term denoting Jews’ refusal to recognize Christ’s divine nature, it acquired a more capacious and ominous meaning in European vernaculars. At a minimum, it denoted Jews’ untrust-worthiness and exclusion from the Christian commonwealth.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-592" href="#calibre_link-202" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 <em class="calibre4">Perfidia</em>
 was also closely linked to usury. Canon 67 (<em class="calibre4">Quanto amplius</em>
 ), the section of the decrees issued at the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) devoted exclusively to Jewish usury and cited by Cleirac in his commentary on marine insurance, began with the premise that “the perfidy of Jews” (<em class="calibre4">Iudaeorum perfidia</em>
 )&mdash;that is, their intention to extract money from the Christian community through high interest rates&mdash;grew in proportion to the ability of Christians to restrain themselves from lending at interest and thus drained resources from the Christian community.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-593" href="#calibre_link-203" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly after the Fourth Lateran Council, a lavishly illustrated manuscript commissioned by the king of France translated those doctrinal precepts into a sinister visual repertoire.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-594" href="#calibre_link-204" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
 Cleirac’s commentary reveals the astounding longevity of such medieval anti-Jewish rhetoric and imagery. Even as late as the mid-seventeenth century, it was still possible to draw on a host of entrenched associations in order to depict marine insurance and bills of exchange as “Jewish from birth” and instruments of “Jewish intrigue”&mdash;that is, as synonyms of usury.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2050">Why Villani?</h3>
<p class="noindent">Twice in his commentary on the <em class="calibre4">Guidon de la mer</em>
 Cleirac attributes the legend to Giovanni Villani’s “universal history,” or <em class="calibre4">Nuova Cronica</em>
 , one of the most famous medieval chronicles written in Italian vernacular. Villani’s account of <span title="41" id="calibre_link-1826"></span>
 the history of Florence from its legendary beginnings in biblical times to 1346, two years before the author’s death from plague, includes no claims about a Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-595" href="#calibre_link-205" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
 So why did Cleirac invoke it? The answer, speculative as it must remain, likely lies again in Cleirac’s tendency to mix fact and fiction. Cleirac had read more than a fair share of Villani’s chronicle and there found several ingredients for his story: the power struggle between the Guelfs and the Ghibellines for the control of Florence and its nearby territories, the city’s banking activities, and Jewish usury. Villani’s firsthand experience as an apprentice and later partner in two of the city’s main trading and banking companies, both of which suffered catastrophic bankruptcies in the 1340s, left a contradictory mark on the chronicle. On the one hand, Villani’s work celebrates the economic ingenuity of the Florentines. On the other hand, his narrative is imbued with a moralizing critique of avarice that derives as much from the religious thought of the time as from the devastating effects of the collapse of the city’s leading banks.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-596" href="#calibre_link-206" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Both themes are echoed in Cleirac’s commentary. In the manuscript draft of what became <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 , a gloss located in the margin of the first article of the <em class="calibre4">Guidon de la mer</em>
 attributes the invention of bills of exchange to Florentine Guelf and Ghibelline expatriates and mentions Villani as the source of information about medieval Florentine and Genoese banking in general (<a href="#calibre_link-70" class="calibre6">figures 2.1</a>
 &ndash;<a href="#calibre_link-72" class="calibre6">2.3</a>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-597" href="#calibre_link-207" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
 This gloss does not mention Jews. It is impossible to ascertain what happened as Cleirac turned the manuscript into a printed volume or what role, if any, his publisher, Guillaume Millanges, played along the way.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-598" href="#calibre_link-208" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
 Two things are certain: Cleirac read large portions of Villani, and, once he committed the legend to print, he did not doubt its veracity. In fact, he expanded it in the second edition of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-599" href="#calibre_link-209" class="calibre6">22</a>
</sup>
 He also repeated it in his later work, <em class="calibre4">Usance du négoce</em>
 , although he did not there attribute it to Villani.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-600" href="#calibre_link-210" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The perennial struggles between the Guelfs and the Ghibellines, which ordinarily ended with one of the two banned from serving in the municipal government, and the workings of Florentine banks are themes that run through Villani’s chronicle and are echoed in Cleirac’s work. In <em class="calibre4">Usance du négoce</em>
 , the French lawyer cites Villani on the history of the minting of the twenty-four-carat golden florin starting in 1251.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-601" href="#calibre_link-211" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 Other references to the fortunes of Tuscan expatriates are less accurate but likely borrowed from Villani, whose history emphasizes the Guelfs’ role in disseminating banking techniques throughout France.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-602" href="#calibre_link-212" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Villani’s chronicle mentions usury in several contexts: sometimes simply to describe private or public credit in general, other times to censure unfair lending practices.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-603" href="#calibre_link-213" class="calibre6">26</a>
</sup>
 It also records specific ecclesiastical doctrines on usury, including the Second Council of Lyon’s condemnation in 1274 of Christian (rather than Jewish) usury, a piece of information that Cleirac would later relay in <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 , although without any specific mention of Villani.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-604" href="#calibre_link-214" class="calibre6">27</a>
</sup>
 Significantly, Villani also describes the expulsion from France of Italian moneylenders (“Lombards”) at the hands of Philip the Fair in 1277, which, as we will see, plays a central role in Cleirac’s argument.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent"><span title="45" id="calibre_link-1672"></span>
 Most revealing of all is a citation from Villani that Cleirac inserts into his commentaries on the <em class="calibre4">coustumier de Guyenne</em>
 , a collection of legal customs from the region of Bordeaux dating from the fourteenth century that underwent reforms in 1520 (Cleirac claims to have consulted the version of the <em class="calibre4">coustumier de Guyenne</em>
 found in the library of Michel de Montaigne).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-606" href="#calibre_link-216" class="calibre6">29</a>
</sup>
 The citation is from book VII, chapter 136, of Villani’s chronicle, a section that contains the most influential version of the story of the miracle of the profaned host, an episode that allegedly occurred in Paris in 1290 and thereafter provided fodder for tales of ritual murder.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-607" href="#calibre_link-217" class="calibre6">30</a>
</sup>
 In this account, a Christian woman brings the host to a Jewish pawnbroker, who tosses it into the fireplace, where it spills blood&mdash; clear proof that it had been consecrated (in Catholic doctrine, the bread of the host through the ritual of the mass miraculously becomes the body of Christ). The rescue of the host and the (different) punishments inflicted on the Christian woman and on the Jewish pawnbroker wrap up the story, which has since been told and retold in myriad texts, paintings, and cheap prints, including, most famously, a sequence of images painted by Paolo Uccello on a predella commissioned by the Confraternity of the Corpus Domini in Urbino in the 1460s (<a href="#calibre_link-73" class="calibre6">figure 2.4</a>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">The Jewish pawnbroker’s sacrilegious act of throwing the host into the fireplace forges a nexus between Jewish usury and Jews’ denial of Christ’s divine nature. For this reason, the alleged miracle of the profaned host nourished some of the most inimical fantasies of medieval antisemitism.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-608" href="#calibre_link-218" class="calibre6">31</a>
</sup>
 We know that Cleirac came across the miracle in Villani’s chronicle. And although he never mentions it explicitly in his writings about commerce and banking, the narrative of the host’s profanation was entirely congruent with the legend’s logic. Following Davanzati’s metaphor, the Jewish pawnbroker misused the host’s blood in the same way as dry exchanges drained blood from the healthy body of the Christian economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac’s tendency to digress and insert untenable stories into his commentaries has discredited his legacy among the few specialists of the history of commercial and maritime law who still recognize his name. At the very least, he has a reputation of being unreliable (his only biographer to date sought to <span title="46" id="calibre_link-1824"></span>
 rescue him from the charge that he was a <em class="calibre4">fantaisiste</em>
 , a fanciful writer).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-609" href="#calibre_link-219" class="calibre6">32</a>
</sup>
 These criticisms obscure the fact that, by means of a thick web of seemingly disjointed citations (almost all of which, it must be noted, are more accurate than the one attributing the legend to Villani), Cleirac wove together a coherent story. In fact, his erroneous ascription to Villani of the statement that Jews invented marine insurance and bills of exchange is less perplexing than the paucity of objections that the statement elicited. It was not until the mid-twentieth century that a scholar of maritime law thought to verify the textual reference to the Florentine chronicler and found it missing.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-610" href="#calibre_link-220" class="calibre6">33</a>
</sup>
 For all too long, Villani was seen as a plausible source of the legend, and the link that Cleirac posited between Jews and usury was regarded as so self-evident that no one challenged the mistaken attribution and, with it, the gist of the story.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2051">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cleirac’s explicit and implicit allusions, scattered throughout his tale of origins, constitute a coherent allegory of bad credit as “Jewish.” I call this tale a legend rather than a myth because Cleirac casts it as a historical narrative; I call it a legend rather than an anecdote because, as the rest of the book shows, it had <span title="47" id="calibre_link-1870"></span>
 an astounding resonance over the following centuries among writers who touched on economic themes in France and across Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">Warning his readers of the terrible consequences of shady (but hard-to-specify) handling of bills of exchange, Cleirac moves from the realm of the law to that of history&mdash;or, better, to that of fictional history. His Middle Ages are half real and half imaginary. No medieval author would have proclaimed marine insurance and bills of exchange to be Jewish inventions, because these obligations were then understood to be the prerogative of the elite Christian merchant-bankers who were also the political and civic leaders of the city-state. For the renowned fifteenth-century mathematician and Franciscan friar Luca Pacioli, “exchange dealers should be blessed instead of being called usurers, Jews, and even worse.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-612" href="#calibre_link-221" class="calibre6">34</a>
</sup>
 Jewish moneylenders at that time were largely confined to lending to the state in return for basic guarantees or to the poor in return for pawns. Medieval Jews ignited Cleirac’s imagination because he saw them as the embodiment of “manifest usurers” (<em class="calibre4">usurarii manifesti</em>
 ): they carried marks of distinction on their clothes, set up their shops in prescribed spaces, and offered their lending services to the public like prostitutes.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-613" href="#calibre_link-222" class="calibre6">35</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In recent decades, scholars have demonstrated that moneylending was not the prevalent, let alone exclusive, economic activity in which Jews were <span title="48" id="calibre_link-1655"></span>
 involved in medieval France, and that where it occurred, Jewish moneylending could bind Christians and Jews together as much as it could pit them against each other.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-614" href="#calibre_link-223" class="calibre6">36</a>
</sup>
 These findings are important correctives to previous misconceptions of European economic and Jewish history, but they do not assist us in the effort to illuminate how contemporary readers might have approached Cleirac’s text. The image of Jewish moneylending that emerges from his commentary reminds us that centuries of verbal and visual indoctrination shaped the views of learned and illiterate Christians alike, no matter what their lived experience might have been.</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac’s Jews were phantoms of a past that allowed his readers to make sense of the present, and the legend he fashioned, or at least broadcast, owed its success to the fact that it used medieval representations of the Jewish usurer to express early modern anxieties about the intricacy and ubiquity of bills of exchange. In it, Jews are first described as the target of expulsions ordered by medieval French kings and an allusion is made to the thirteenth-century miracle of the consecrated host. Then, through a fast-paced narrative, an ostensibly Jewish invention, bills of exchange, is said to have reached its pinnacle in Amsterdam, the seventeenth-century capital of the world economy, a hub of commercial credit (rather than pawnbroking), and home to the most interdenominational of all early modern European commercial societies. In piecing this story together, Cleirac falls back on the figure of the Jewish usurer as a defensive mechanism at a time when the increasing impersonality of market exchanges was perceived as threatening established social hierarchies and traditional forms of authority. The next chapter will illustrate how the figure of the Jewish usurer seized by Cleirac was at once tenacious and malleable, dual qualities that account for the legend’s persistence and plasticity.</p>

<span class="small1">THE NOTION THAT</span>
 the church stalled economic development in Catholic Europe and, conversely, that a few brave merchants succeeded in business by ignoring Catholic doctrines about usury, at least until their last confession, long dominated lay and scholarly views of the Middle Ages, particularly in the Anglo-American world. But a fertile field of historiographical research in the past half century has put these views to rest and made us fully aware of what Étienne Cleirac and his contemporaries knew all too well: the Catholic Church neither opposed all forms of profit and entrepreneurship nor turned a blind eye to infringements of its own doctrines; instead, it struggled to reach a consensus regarding acceptable forms of wealth and wealth management. From this perspective, we can recognize Cleirac’s tirades against Jews and usury as vernacular expressions of learned debates about which contracts were illegitimate and which agreeable, as well as about who could permissibly be party to either.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">The next chapter will situate Cleirac and his works in the context of their time. For now, I will resume my analysis of his text where I left it. Cleirac’s words locate him at an important and little understood historical junction, when the late medieval habit of treating money and the economy as part of the moral and theological universe intersected with the emerging “science of commerce,” that is, the increasingly secularized literature that discussed commerce as a profession and an object of government policies.<sup class="calibre7">

 This literature assigned multifarious meanings to the word <em class="calibre4">usury</em>
 . Church doctrines about usury were neither uniform nor uncontested. Different definitions of the practice coexisted, and clergymen granted considerable leeway to ecclesiastical or secular tribunals investigating those charged with the sin (a sin that in some polities had been made into a crime). The most salient phase in these debates, <span title="50" id="calibre_link-1687"></span>
 for the purpose of understanding Cleirac’s musings on the topic, occurred in the sixteenth century, when Catholic theologians devised new and subtle arguments about the legitimacy of various financial contracts, including marine insurance and bills of exchange, in order to control but not hamper the expansion of European commercial society.</p>
<p class="indent">By the eighteenth century, writers of the <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 treated the term <em class="calibre4">usury</em>
 as a placeholder for all sorts of unsavory economic behaviors, and because of the enduring influence of an earlier discourse, they often assumed that Jews personified such behaviors. As a result, allusions to Jews continued to function as symbolic standards against which economic conduct could be measured long after the Middle Ages.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2052">Usury and Its Enigmas</h3>
<p class="noindent">Historians cannot determine the interest rates charged on bills of exchange because they were included in the currency conversion rate. The stratagem was similar to the one that a series of recent consolidated class actions alleged Visa, Mastercard, and Diners Club had engaged in as a way of hiding foreign transaction fees behind currency conversion rates.<sup class="calibre7">

 Some scholars assume that in the premodern period this expedient allowed merchants and bankers to avoid charges of usury and represented the ingenuity of Catholic merchants wishing to bypass canon law. In reality, theologians and canon lawyers were not easily fooled. As the complexity of bills of exchange grew, so did the financial expertise of those intent on combating usury and the intricacies of church rules condemning it. That is why, a few specialists aside, “usury is perhaps the most ridiculed, but least understood, idea in the history of economics.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-618" href="#calibre_link-427" class="calibre6">4</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">The Old Testament (Exodus 22:24&ndash;25, Leviticus 23:33&ndash;37, Deuteronomy 23:19&ndash;20, Psalms 15:5), one passage in the Gospel of Luke (6:34&ndash;35), and several Patristic texts provided authoritative scriptural foundations for the strictest position articulated in Gratian’s <em class="calibre4">Decretum</em>
 , according to which “any sum returned in excess to the principal is usury.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-619" href="#calibre_link-428" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
 Thomist theologians meanwhile rediscovered Aristotle’s doctrine of the sterility of money (<em class="calibre4">Politics</em>
 1:10, <em class="calibre4">Nicomachean Ethics</em>
 5:5), which they adopted as a complementary anti-usury argument.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-620" href="#calibre_link-429" class="calibre6">6</a>
</sup>
 But even before Reformed leaders in the sixteenth century questioned strict Scholastic interpretations of usury, Catholic moral theologians and canon lawyers had already devised two sets of responses to this thorny problem, both of which are reflected in Cleirac’s commentary: the first developed new taxonomies of legitimate and illegitimate credit contracts; the second approached charges of usurious behavior on an ad hoc basis, judging <span title="51" id="calibre_link-1648"></span>
 conduct case by case and issuing exceptions rather than sweeping condemnations. All anti-usury injunctions, in any case, only applied to Christians. Excluded from the community of believers, Jews were allowed to charge interest and soon became widely accepted symbols of rapacious moneylending.</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac derives his equation of Jews and usury from some of the most bellicose Christian depictions of this equivalence, notably those by Church Father Ambrose of Milan and Canon 67 of the Fourth Lateran Council.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-621" href="#calibre_link-430" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
 In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council required Jews living amid Christians to wear distinctive clothing and crystallized the association between Jews and usury in Canon 67, which described Christian society and church properties as being devoured by Jews, who were said to extort “heavy and immoderate usuries” (<em class="calibre4">graves immoderatasque usuras</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-622" href="#calibre_link-431" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
 At the time, some Jewish scholars who were fully versed in Scholastic thought challenged church doctrine and Christian hypocrisy in matters of Jewish moneylending.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-623" href="#calibre_link-432" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
 But these texts were neither accessible nor of interest to Cleirac. His training and his faith took him else-where&mdash;specifically, to the new ethics developed by moral theologians and canon lawyers, especially Franciscan friars, for mercantile urban elites in the wake of the commercial revolution of the Middle Ages and to the writings of their sixteenth-century successors.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike earlier medieval monks who railed against the moneyed economy, Franciscan friars did not condemn all forms of profit. Rather, they scrutinized each and every business contract, outlined theories of just prices and private property, and devised ingenious justifications of the church’s management of its own large landed and movable wealth. Aiming to regulate the market according to its moral principles, the church strove to distinguish between usury and beneficial credit transactions rather than banning all profit-making activities. Bernardino da Siena (d. 1444), the vocal Franciscan preacher later proclaimed a saint and a leader of antisemitic persecutions, was among the many in his order who not only denounced fraud and avarice but also stressed the positive impact that trade had on civic life: “Nothing contributes to the Commune so much as the profit of the guilds and of the merchandize that is bought and sold,” he declared.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-624" href="#calibre_link-433" class="calibre6">10</a>
</sup>
 Literal readings of scripture never went away, but the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church came to encompass a variety of competing definitions of usury, and theologians, moral philosophers, and canon and civil lawyers debated which credit instruments were legitimate and which were not.</p>
<p class="indent">Marine insurance was among the first credit contracts to find wide acceptance. Pope Gregory IX’s decretal <em class="calibre4">Naviganti</em>
 (1236) denied that the assumption of risk (<em class="calibre4">periculum sortis</em>
 ) justified charging any interest, but its wording left the <span title="52" id="calibre_link-1755"></span>
 door open to protracted disquisitions about the nature of usury.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-625" href="#calibre_link-434" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
 Only a few decades later, the noted Franciscan John Duns Scotus admitted that professional merchants were allowed to derive a profit in exchange for servicing society at large (as long as their commercial activities involved neither fraud nor duress) and, more specifically, that they could be paid a premium to cover the risk of transporting goods.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-626" href="#calibre_link-435" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
 By the early fifteenth century, the Florentine lawyer Lorenzo Ridolfi and others had proposed a different but even more powerful counterargument to the papal injunction of 1236: marine insurance was acceptable because it was not a loan but a type of contract unknown in ancient Roman law (<em class="calibre4">contractus innominatus</em>
 ), a form of lease in which the insurer took on the assumption of risk from the merchant and was entitled to demand remuneration in exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-627" href="#calibre_link-436" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The recognition that marine insurance provided collective benefits and its classification as a lease paved the way for the full legitimation of premium insurance. During the next period of rapid economic growth, the sixteenth century, the most influential moral theologians at the University of Salamanca, including two Dominicans, Francisco de Vitoria (1492&ndash;1546) and Domingo de Soto (1495&ndash;1560), and the Jesuit Luis de Molina (1535&ndash;1600), reaffirmed the legitimacy of marine insurance. In <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 , Cleirac cites a well-known Spanish confessional manual of the time to support his statement that marine insurance is an asset to the flourishing of the state.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-628" href="#calibre_link-437" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
 Molina proved particularly influential in this regard because he argued that marine insurance was a purchase-and-sale contract, rather than a credit contract, and thus not susceptible to usury charges.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-629" href="#calibre_link-438" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 Jurists embraced his definition, which the Genoese commercial law expert Sigismondo Scaccia repeated in 1619.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-630" href="#calibre_link-439" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac knew this argument well, since it constituted the core principle of the first article of the <em class="calibre4">Guidon de la mer</em>
 , the object of his commentary.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-631" href="#calibre_link-440" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
 He was even familiar with pertinent jurisprudence that adopted this definition. Indeed, before introducing the extravagant tale of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange, Cleirac notes that the high civil court of Genoa, the <em class="calibre4">Rota</em>
 , defined marine insurance as a purchase-and-sale contract in which the price was justified and determined by the risk involved (“emptioni &amp; venditoni propter prætium quod datur ratione periculi”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-632" href="#calibre_link-441" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The same logic came to be applied to bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-633" href="#calibre_link-442" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
 They passed muster as long as, following Aristotle and Roman law, they were classified not as money (which could be loaned) but as nonfungible goods like horses and real estate, which were not susceptible to a loan contract (<em class="calibre4">mutuum</em>
 ) because they could be returned in the same condition as when they were given.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-634" href="#calibre_link-443" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
 Sustained through longer and fully-articulated disquisitions, the argument was widely <span title="53" id="calibre_link-1679"></span>
 accepted by the time Cleirac penned his commentary, with one important caveat: whereas marine insurance was no longer suspected of being usurious, different types of bills of exchange still stirred considerable controversy. The majority of churchmen accepted as legitimate four-party bills, which they described as “real exchanges,” but suspicion continued to follow more complex instruments, such as dry exchange, that had come to the fore at the financial fairs of Lyon and Besançon and in Europe’s major commercial hubs.</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac appears to have been well acquainted with these technical debates and the leading voices of Second Scholasticism, who had updated Franciscan teachings to address the increasing financial sophistication of the time. With unusual clarity, he synthesizes the views of two leading Catholic theologians of the sixteenth century: “In reality, those banking activities and insurances that are treated as honorable, upright, and legal activities are greatly useful and helpful to business, even according to the opinion of Thomas de Vio, known as Cardinal Cajetan, in his <em class="calibre4">Tractatus de cambijs</em>
 , chapter 5, and Navarrus, in his <em class="calibre4">Enchiridion</em>
 , chapter 17, no. 284.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Dominican Tommaso de Vio, better known as Cardinal Cajetan (1469&ndash;1534), is usually remembered as a commentator of Aquinas’s <em class="calibre4">Summa</em>
 and a fierce opponent of the Reformation (he questioned Luther at the Diet of Augsburg in 1518&ndash;1519 and refused to annul Henry VIII’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon). But he was also the author of several treatises on the economy, including one on exchange dealings, <em class="calibre4">De cambiis</em>
 , written in 1499 and first published in 1506, which sought to categorize licit and illicit forms of exchange and concluded that neither moneychanging involving real coins nor classic bills of exchange were usurious, only re-exchange contracts and dry exchange. Having rejected the notion that four-party bills of exchange were loans, Cajetan’s treatise, in the chapter that Cleirac cites, affirmed the usefulness of honest moneychangers who acted for the well-being of society (<em class="calibre4">civitas</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-635" href="#calibre_link-444" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac’s other reference in this passage is to Martín Azpilcueta, also known as Doctor Navarrus (1491&ndash;1586), another towering figure of Second Scholasticism. The <em class="calibre4">Enchiridion</em>
 , Navarrus’s handbook for confessors and penitents, distilled subtle moral and economic arguments about topics such as usury, ecclesiastical properties, and money, and became an extremely popular publication. Chapter 17 of the <em class="calibre4">Enchiridion</em>
 was a commentary on the seventh commandment, “Thou shalt not steal,” and delivered a harsh condemnation of usury. Cleirac zooms in on a section that Navarrus added to the revised Latin edition of his handbook focusing on dry exchange as opposed to the four-party bill of exchange. There, agreeing with Cajetan, de Soto, and others, Navarrus declared dry exchange to be against natural, divine, and human justice.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-636" href="#calibre_link-445" class="calibre6">22</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="54" id="calibre_link-1756"></span>
 It was precisely this differentiation between unmitigated censures of usury and condemnations of certain types of bills of exchange that interested Cleirac and that he helped popularize. Like most of his contemporaries, however, he clearly found the taxonomy of contractual forms to be insufficient for establishing what constituted acceptable credit practices. To complement the frameworks proposed by moral philosophers and canon and civil lawyers, Cleirac turned to a familiar cultural referent: the figure of the Jewish usurer.</p>
<p class="indent">The oblivion into which the legend we are grappling with has fallen today has much to do with the fact that modern scholars of commercial and maritime law are accustomed to thinking that by the seventeenth century, this field of inquiry had entered the sphere of politics and left that of theology. In reality, the figure of the Jewish usurer hardly disappeared from the early modern imagination and impressed on readers the notion of improper financial behavior more effectively than did arguments based on casuistry and canon law. A 1585 French manual of practical arithmetic instructed merchants to calculate compound interest at the same time as it denounced compound interest as “usury of usury” and a Jewish habit that was “execrable” and “abominable” (two adjectives that, as we saw in <a href="#calibre_link-3" class="calibre6">chapter 2</a>
 , were typical of anti-Jewish Christian polemics).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-637" href="#calibre_link-446" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
 Forty years later, a treatise on bills of exchange called dry exchange “adulterous,” conflating sexual transgression with financial immorality.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-638" href="#calibre_link-447" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 Cleirac concurred and added that dry exchange was “pure Jewishness” (<em class="calibre4">pure Iuifverie</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-639" href="#calibre_link-448" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Even if he was particularly insistent in linking usury to Jews, Cleirac was not alone in this tendency among the authors of early modern didactic texts about merchant practice, whom we might otherwise assume would have taken a more neutral stance. In order to pinpoint specific contracts as acceptable or unacceptable, these texts resorted to the same association between Jews and usury. They thus demonstrate the power of language and tradition to police the boundaries of proper credit and to define, at least in negative terms, ethical standards of behavior and sources of collective identification.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2053">From Jews to Lombards and Cahorsins</h3>
<p class="noindent">Midway into the narrative of what I am calling the legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange, Cleirac shifts his target, if not his tone. Having called both credit instruments “Jewish from birth, both in their invention and denomination,” he explains that Jews were not the worst <span title="55" id="calibre_link-1688"></span>
 culprits in the crime of lending at interest. Even more repugnant, he claims, were those Christians who adopted “this Jewish intrigue” and, “after they retained the models of these letters [i.e., bills of exchange], learned to use them effectively.” He refers to these individuals as “Lombards and Cahorsins.”</p>
<p class="blockquote">The unexpected arrival of this sort of usurers from south of the Alps caused them [i.e., the Jews] great discontent and pain, because they [i.e., the Jews] saw that their imitators, their disciples, their acolytes, and their wretched clerks had mastered the art of usury to an even greater extent than they did; they [i.e., Lombard bankers] had become even more evil and malicious insofar as usury and rapaciousness were concerned; they bent and concocted their practices, and extracted from people greater profits and loot than Jews dared to aim for or demand; and those scoundrels were now being treated as noblemen, held in esteem as men of honor and merit, and considerably well-placed in their favors&mdash;<em class="calibre4">e lodati ne van, non che impuniti</em>
 &mdash; whereas Jews were hated, treated as jackanapes, and continuously ridiculed with contempt and affront, marked with a yellow hat, harassed as pages and lackeys at every occasion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Lombards, originally hailing from Asti in Piedmont, were licensed Christian moneylenders and bankers whose presence became particularly visible in those regions of Europe from which Jews had been expelled. By 1323, Paris had a Rue des Lombards. The town of Cahors, north of Toulouse, was also invariably associated with devious Christian bankers. Specialists have since corrected several misconceptions concerning the alleged rapaciousness of Lombards and Cahorsins.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-640" href="#calibre_link-449" class="calibre6">26</a>
</sup>
 Here, however, it is the traditional image of these groups as incarnations of avarice and duplicity that matters more than the reality of their lending practices. In this portrayal, the terms <em class="calibre4">Lombards</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">Cahorsins</em>
 lost all geographical specificity and became stands-in for usurious Christian moneylenders. A businessman defending the noted Tuscan merchant Francesco Datini after he joined the guild of bankers and money-changers (<em class="calibre4">Arte del Cambio</em>
 ) in 1398, for example, declared: “‘They will say, he is a <em class="calibre4">caor sino</em>
 ’ and I reply, ‘He does not do it to be a usurer, for he will leave all he has to the poor!’”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-641" href="#calibre_link-450" class="calibre6">27</a>
</sup>
 A near contemporary of Cleirac wrote that <em class="calibre4">Lombard</em>
 announced the presence of usury in the same way as <em class="calibre4">Monte di Pietà</em>
 signaled the absence of usury.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-642" href="#calibre_link-451" class="calibre6">28</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In canto XI of Dante’s <em class="calibre4">Inferno</em>
 , Cahors takes the place of Gomorrah next to Sodom&mdash;a passage that Cleirac cites in full.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-643" href="#calibre_link-452" class="calibre6">29</a>
</sup>
 Following the Aristotelian view absorbed by Thomist theology that “money is barren,” sodomy became <span title="56" id="calibre_link-1628"></span>
 a synonym for usury. Cleirac finds confirmation of the analogy between Jewish usury and nonreproductive sex in Paul’s epistle to the Ephesians (5:3&ndash;5), which branded all “fornicators” as “idolaters.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-644" href="#calibre_link-453" class="calibre6">30</a>
</sup>
 The Benedictine monk and English chronicler Matthew Paris (d. 1259), Cleirac’s most trusted guide in matters of usury (he is cited a total of five times), denounced not only Jews but also those Christian merchants and bankers who succeeded in “cloaking their usury under the shadow of trade” (“usuram sub specie negotiationis palliantes”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-645" href="#calibre_link-454" class="calibre6">31</a>
</sup>
 Usury, like sodomy, was viewed as an antisocial behavior, and Jews were alleged to excel at it. Blaming Jews for all the evils that had befallen Christian society, a seventeenth-century Portuguese polemicist accused them of having introduced sodomy and incest in Portugal and Africa and described them, drawing on a popular trope of the day, as dogs and horses that could not control their instincts (“cães ou cavalos desenfreados”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-646" href="#calibre_link-455" class="calibre6">32</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In Cleirac’s words, Lombards and Cahorsins “mastered the art of usury to an even greater extent than they [the Jews] did” and “extracted from people greater profits and loot than Jews dared to aim for or demand.” Having learned to use bills of exchange (“these Jewish inventions”), Christian bankers now only handled “the feather and the sheet of paper,” that is, intangible credit instruments rather than minted coins. In so doing, they confounded debtors and preyed on them more easily.</p>
<p class="indent">In Cleirac’s assessment, Lombards not only had “become even more evil and malicious insofar as usury and rapaciousness were concerned” but were also, concerningly, “treated as noblemen, held in esteem as men of honor and merit.” In this serious indictment of Christian rulers and society, Cleirac’s humanistic education comes to his rescue, affording him a touch of humor in an otherwise grim portrait. He turns to the Renaissance Italian poet Ludovico Ariosto, who satirized the frequency with which Jews were “harassed . . . at every occasion” (<em class="calibre4">I supposti</em>
 , III.1) and denounced the hypocrisy of punishing women for adultery while praising men for the same sin (<em class="calibre4">Orlando Furioso</em>
 , IV.66.8).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-647" href="#calibre_link-456" class="calibre6">33</a>
</sup>
 In spite of the comic relief provided by Ariosto, Cleirac still insists on the gravity of the problem. At least “Jews were hated, treated as jackanapes, and continuously ridiculed,” he notes. The requirement that they be “marked with a yellow hat” literalized their status as outcasts. But what, if anything, could cordon off Lombards from other Christians? All other measures having failed, the 1274 church canon entitled <em class="calibre4">The Abyss of Usury</em>
 (a document mentioned by Villani) demanded that Christian rulers expel foreign Christian moneylenders from all their domains (<a href="#calibre_link-3" class="calibre6">chapter 2</a>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="57" id="calibre_link-1823"></span>
 Cleirac gives the following summary of those historical events: “Eventually, these Lombard bankers became so intolerable due to their exorbitant usurious charges, exactions, extortions and illicit profits, that they were treated in France in the same fashion as Jews were.” He recounts the sequence of expulsions of Lombards from medieval France in greater detail than he provides for their Jewish equivalents, singling out those ordered by Saint Louis (r. 1226&ndash;1270) and Philip the Fair (r. 1285&ndash;1314). Cleirac also laments that Lombards (“these rustics”) continued to wield considerable influence at court and in 1311 were readmitted to the kingdom “on condition that they would become honest in the future and would abstain from all their bad practices.” That did not happen. In fact, “instead of reforming themselves, these parasitical hypocrites became even more dissolute.” King Philip VI of Valois (r. 1328&ndash;1350) had no choice but to expel them. Finally, in 1347, he “purged his kingdom of them and drove them out of France.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-648" href="#calibre_link-457" class="calibre6">34</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">When relaying the chronology of Jews’ expulsions from medieval France in the first part of his narrative, Cleirac makes no reference to specific chronicles or other sources of information. By contrast, when outlining the actions taken by French kings against foreign Christian moneylenders, he offers more details and relies not only on older narratives by the chronicler Jean Froissart (c. 1337&ndash;c. 1405) and the royal secretary and historian Nicole Gilles (d. 1503), but also on more recent writers, including Étienne Pasquier (1529&ndash;1615), a historian one generation younger than Cleirac who based his work on documents he had examined firsthand while an officer in the royal treasury.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-649" href="#calibre_link-458" class="calibre6">35</a>
</sup>
 A compilation by French lawyer and jurist Adam Théveneau serves as a further reminder that public authorities had taken steps to curb usury in France since the fourteenth century.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-650" href="#calibre_link-459" class="calibre6">36</a>
</sup>
 Catholic authors like Cleirac, in other words, had access to considerably less factual information about the Jewish past than the Christian past, but this imbalance did not prevent them from using a few known episodes in Jewish history for didactic purposes.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2054">Jewish Usury: Theology, Law, and Metaphor</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the end, the primary targets of Cleirac’s spiteful portrayal of Jews are not Jews themselves but Lombards, Cahorsins, Guelfs, and all other Christian bankers: “These malicious liars, whose frauds are aimed to take people by surprise and to pillage their fortunes, . . . enriched themselves at the expense of their debtors, whom they initially pretended to wish to assist charitably in <span title="58" id="calibre_link-1725"></span>
 their adversities, only to lure them into their net.” The ill intent of those able to manipulate credit instruments with ease was viewed as even more lamentable because it exploited naïve borrowers whose needs were pressing. Cleirac describes Christian bankers who had perfected the art of trading in bills of exchange as predatory lenders:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Having hooked their debtors, they became even more eager to seize every possible gain, to exact usury, exchange and re-exchange rates, stipulate fines, expenditures, damages and interest, and other such shameful incremental charges, so that they never wanted to receive back the principal as long as the debtor was left solvent. They were elated by the facility with which deeds of protest and overdue terms could apply. When a debtor was weak or in difficulty, they never left him in peace, but tormented him at every scheduled date when interest payments came due, that is, every month (because in these matters <em class="calibre4">usance</em>
 and month are synonyms, in the sense that usury means interest payments stipulated by month) and they never ended their harassment until they had taken everything from their debtors.</p>
<p class="indent">Layered with technical language, this merciless denunciation of Lombards and Cahorsins indicates that, no matter how extravagant his commentary may appear to us, Cleirac assumed his readers were well versed in the financial intricacies of bills of exchange. He also counted on them to recognize the description of Christian bankers as “imitators,” “disciples,” “acolytes,” and “wretched clerks” of Jews. As Léon Poliakov noted more than fifty years ago, to say “‘Jewish usury’ does not necessarily mean that it is or was carried on by Jews.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-651" href="#calibre_link-460" class="calibre6">37</a>
</sup>
 <em class="calibre4">Peius iudaizare</em>
 , or “behaving in a manner even worse than the Jews,” is how the Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux (1090&ndash;1153) famously described the conduct of Christian moneylenders, adding that it would be more appropriate to call them “baptized Jews” than Christians.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-652" href="#calibre_link-461" class="calibre6">38</a>
</sup>
 In the early Christian church, the sin of “Judaizing” described the actions of those Jews who had recently converted to Christianity but continued to observe certain rites of their former religion, such as fasting and circumcision. During the medieval commercial revolution, the verb “to Judaize” ceased to carry a literal meaning and became the cornerstone of a discursive edifice in which Christian usurers were cast as “baptized Jews.”</p>
<p class="indent">Wherever Jewish converts to Christianity were a lived reality, the insidious analogy between Christian usurers and “baptized Jews” acquired particular <span title="59" id="calibre_link-1726"></span>

 It was in the aftermath of the mass conversions that occurred in Spain after the violent pogroms against Jews of the 1390s that the Valencian Dominican preacher Saint Vincent Ferrer (1350&ndash;1419) railed: “Today, nearly everything is avarice, for almost everyone commits usury, which used not to be done except by Jews. But today Christians do it too, as if they were Jews.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-654" href="#calibre_link-463" class="calibre6">40</a>
</sup>
 This rhetorical casting of Christian merchants who engaged in unacceptable behavior as Jews gained enormous traction and lived on well beyond the confines of those locations where the recently converted Jews were the object of policing and suspicion.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">To call a dishonest Christian a Jew was the easiest answer to a wrenching question: What defined a good merchant? No single or uniform Catholic theory of usury existed. Even theologians’ obsessive attempts to create typologies of credit contracts, such as those formulated by Cajetan and Navarrus, did not resolve the matter. Part of the ambiguity was intentional. Thirteenth-century theologians and canon lawyers had devised a vast array of “exceptions” to the stringent norm that “any sum returned in excess to the principal is usury.” These exceptions were not aberrations but rather constitutive elements of a moral and theological paradigm designed to make the reputation ( <em class="calibre4">fama</em>
 ) of contracting parties a defining criterion of the legitimacy of credit contracts and thus to understand market exchanges as mirrors of social relations and hierarchies that existed outside of the marketplace.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-656" href="#calibre_link-465" class="calibre6">42</a>
</sup>
 In this sense, the antisocial nature of usury retained its versatile symbolic power well beyond the historical context in which it emerged (the moral theology of the early thirteenth century). That is why Cleirac could still mobilize the trope of Jewish usury in the seventeenth century, when commercial society was acquiring more pronounced contractual features.</p>
<p class="indent">Government tribunals did not offer clearer directives on usury than the church. Secular authorities turned many sexual and economic sins into crimes, but in matters of usury, it was the latitude, rather than strictures, of theological and canonical definitions that influenced civil law and jurisprudence, especially in Catholic states.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-657" href="#calibre_link-466" class="calibre6">43</a>
</sup>
 France long resisted setting a cap on the interest allowed on private loans, and both norms and customs of lending varied greatly across the kingdom. During Cleirac’s lifetime, royal legislation still formally forbade lending at interest and reiterated the state’s opposition to all forms of usury.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-658" href="#calibre_link-467" class="calibre6">44</a>
</sup>
 A special regime was devised for certain types of long-term credit instruments backed by collateral, which normally took the form of real estate; such instruments were in essence private annuities that demanded the <span title="60" id="calibre_link-1821"></span>
 repayment of low rates of interest (<em class="calibre4">rentes perpétuelles</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">rentes viagères</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-659" href="#calibre_link-468" class="calibre6">45</a>

 The crown capped interest rates on annuities at 6.25 percent per annum in 1601 and lowered this ceiling to 5 percent in 1655, where it stayed for most of the eighteenth century.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-660" href="#calibre_link-469" class="calibre6">46</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, royal authorities exhibited considerable hesitation about setting similar terms for commercial credit. The city of Lyon was the exception. There, royal edicts spoke of “interest” rather than “usury” in reference to bills transacted at the fairs to shield them from criticism.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-661" href="#calibre_link-470" class="calibre6">47</a>
</sup>
 Jean-Baptiste Colbert sought to codify a lawful 5 percent interest rate for commercial loans, but the committee he charged with drafting the 1673 ordinance on commerce rejected his proposal for fear of antagonizing the Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne, which opposed the measure because it put a price on usury. As a compromise, the final 1673 ordinance (title VI, art. 1) allowed merchants and others dealing in bills of exchange to charge interest, but not to hide it behind the principal (which is what all merchants did).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-662" href="#calibre_link-471" class="calibre6">48</a>
</sup>
 The discrepancy between law and practice, however, soon gave way to rampant abuses and inspired reformers like Étienne Bonnot de Condillac and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot in the 1770s to call for legitimizing interest-bearing loans and letting the market equalize their rates.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-663" href="#calibre_link-472" class="calibre6">49</a>
</sup>
 The arbiters who adjudicated lawsuits over bills of exchange for the commercial court of Paris sometimes detected an injury (<em class="calibre4">lésion</em>
 ) in the exchange rate and recommended compensation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-664" href="#calibre_link-473" class="calibre6">50</a>

 Only the Revolution lifted all legal restrictions on charging interest on loans and moved to regulate interest rates on October 12, 1789.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-665" href="#calibre_link-474" class="calibre6">51</a>
</sup>
 Until then, though they were never numerous, usury trials were held and offenders punished with bans and rites of public humiliation reminiscent of earlier times, in which they were made to kneel in public squares holding a sign labeling them “manifest usurers.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-666" href="#calibre_link-475" class="calibre6">52</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Evidently, it was not to positive law or to the courts that one could turn in the mid-seventeenth century for clear-cut answers about the legitimacy of all forms of bills of exchange. Merchant manuals and legal commentaries sought to fill the void. The extent to which these texts, which varied in scope, originality, and precision, were meant and able to impart practical knowledge to aspiring or experienced practitioners remains debatable. Most certainly, they fulfilled a different but essential function in the self-regulation of European commercial society: they forged a shared understanding of the cultural underpinnings that sustained the more or less detailed formal norms of the credit contracts they illustrated.</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac partook in this effort. His predecessors, including Jean Trenchant and Mathias Maréschal, had followed more conventional paths, adopting the <span title="61" id="calibre_link-1796"></span>
 taxonomy of legitimate and illegitimate bills of exchange established by moral theologians.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-667" href="#calibre_link-476" class="calibre6">53</a>
</sup>
 A trained lawyer, Cleirac oscillates between an all-encompassing meaning of usury as improper economic practice and a narrower jurisprudential approach. In <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 , in addition to citing the opinions of theologians like Cajetan, Navarrus, and Coli, who all declared dry exchange to be usurious, he mentions a sentence (<em class="calibre4">arrêt</em>
 ) issued by Bordeaux’s royal appellate court (<em class="calibre4">parlement</em>
 ) on July 16, 1637, confirming an earlier ruling of the city’s commercial tribunal against someone caught using dry exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-668" href="#calibre_link-477" class="calibre6">54</a>
</sup>
 Cleirac exhibits a more contradictory attitude toward marine insurance. He dismisses those who still regarded it as a form of speculation rather than as the price of risk, but he also stresses the uncertainty under which premiums were negotiated and enforced (e.g., the difficulty of verifying when a shipwreck occurred, the incompetence of ship captains who prolonged a voyage) and calls underwriters “truly usurious and Jewish” for speculating on this uncertainty.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-669" href="#calibre_link-478" class="calibre6">55</a>
</sup>
 Rather than expressing unrelenting opposition to all credit contracts, these accusations confirm the facility with which Cleirac summoned the figure of the Jewish usurer to condemn economic practices that he judged to be unfair but the dubiousness of which he could not better articulate.</p>
<p class="indent">In his treatise on bills of exchange, <em class="calibre4">Usance du négoce</em>
 (a shorter work than <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 and a standalone piece rather than a commentary), Cleirac also alternates between description and moralizing admonishment, between crude attacks against usury and subtler accounts of specific credit contracts, between accurate citations and fanciful readings. In addition to Cajetan and Navarrus, he invokes a noted Florentine merchant in Flanders, Ludovico Guicciardini, to argue that four-party bills of exchange are “useful and genuine, when used with moderation and loyalty.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-670" href="#calibre_link-479" class="calibre6">56</a>
</sup>
 He stresses the need to combine the knowledge of customary norms related to bills of exchange with “human prudence.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-671" href="#calibre_link-480" class="calibre6">57</a>
</sup>
 Unable to define how exactly “human prudence” affects credit operations, he singles out people whom he asserts obviously lack this quality: Jews, to be sure, since they were “cheaters” and thus willing to take advantage of any opportunity regardless of its consequences, but also “Mohammedans,” “Turks,” and “Saracens,” all of whom lagged behind the Jews in financial sophistication.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-672" href="#calibre_link-481" class="calibre6">58</a>
</sup>
 With rare precision, in one instance, he gives a number to the practices he describes: 12 percent annual interest, by his estimation, was the standard rate charged by “bankers, Jews, and dirty usurers.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-673" href="#calibre_link-482" class="calibre6">59</a>
</sup>
 Reverting to old habits, he calls dry exchange “a business of Jews and Cahorsins.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-674" href="#calibre_link-483" class="calibre6">60</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In so many words, Cleirac reveals the impossibility of giving a precise and exhaustive definition of “good business.” Nowhere does he define usury <span title="62" id="calibre_link-1822"></span>
 in unambiguous terms. Rather, usury is how he refers to everything he regards as the opposite of prudent, upright, and legal ways of handling bills of exchange. As the next chapter will show, Cleirac’s marketplace promoted talent and created new riches, but it was also full of menaces and villains, replete with jealousy between groups, and haunted by the possibility of fraud. It was anything but an ecumenical meeting place of faceless merchants, seafarers, and underwriters. Regulation mattered (that is why Cleirac chose to study maritime and commercial law in the first place), yet regulation alone could not guarantee the fair conduct of trade. Cleirac resorted to stereotyping not only because prejudice against Jews was rooted in the mentality of the time, but also because written norms about bills of exchange and other financial instruments were still sparse during the first half of the seventeenth century. By conjuring “Jewish extortion” (<em class="calibre4">Iuifve tortionaire</em>
 ), he could explain the ineffable: objectionable ways of handling bills of exchange that went undetected.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-675" href="#calibre_link-484" class="calibre6">61</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Should Cleirac’s railing against Jews and others he lumps together with them ultimately surprise us? The answer is yes and no. His words are more venomous than those that punctuate other merchant manuals, legal commentaries, and dictionaries of trade, and his work is sometimes amateurish. But his habit of alternating between technical disquisitions about credit instruments, tenets of moral theology, and invocations of Jewish usury as the archetype of financial misconduct would have been entirely recognizable to his readers. In this respect, <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 belongs to the continental literature on commercial and maritime law of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which, Rodolfo Savelli reminds us, displayed a distinctive osmosis of law, theology, and merchant culture.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-676" href="#calibre_link-485" class="calibre6">62</a>

 As the language of commerce became more and more secular, it did not shed its didactic invocations of Jewish usury.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2055">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">This chapter and the previous one have parsed Cleirac’s jumbled arguments in an effort to render them as intelligible as I believe they would have been to his many seventeenth-century readers. In the process, I have set aside an important detail to which we must return. Cleirac maintains that “insurance policies and bills of exchange were unknown to ancient Roman jurisprudence.” This portion of his otherwise outlandish account of the emergence of Europe’s financial instruments is truthful and, far from representing a mere legal technicality, <span title="63" id="calibre_link-1782"></span>
 gestures toward a pivotal component of the logic that undergirds the legend.</p>
<p class="indent">Medieval and early modern legal scholars searched long and hard for the Roman origins of both marine insurance and bills of exchange and eventually concluded that premium-based insurance, the forerunner of our modern forms of insurance, as opposed to other risk-sharing agreements, did not exist in antiquity and that examples of credit transfers noted by classical authors did not amount to proper bills of exchange. The sentence of the Genoese Rota with which Cleirac opens his commentary on the first article of the <em class="calibre4">Guidon de la mer</em>
 defined marine insurance as a <em class="calibre4">contractus innominatus</em>
 (“nameless contract”), a category developed by medieval jurists to indicate contracts that did not have a specific equivalent in the Roman civil law of obligations. Thus called because they lacked a name in the authoritative ancient sources, nameless contracts were voluntary bilateral agreements in which each party, acting with equal contractual power, promised to do his part to fulfill the agreement.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-677" href="#calibre_link-486" class="calibre6">63</a>
</sup>
 Marine insurance and bills of exchange fell into this category, which Cleirac, a graduate of law, knew well.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-678" href="#calibre_link-487" class="calibre6">64</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Improbable as their designation sounds, nameless contracts belong to a momentous chapter in the history of European law, one during which new legal classifications emerged as expressions of the political and social order of city-states where, after the late eleventh century, urban elites tied to commercial interests affirmed their independence from the feudal aristocracy. The late medieval growth of long-distance trade demanded that full contractual rights be given to social groups that until then had been regarded as inferior to the titled nobility. It also demanded the recognition of new financial contracts and the development of new doctrines and customary practices to absorb those contracts into existing legal systems. The two requirements were really one. Reciprocity, consensus, and good faith were the defining elements of the new contracts, which were in turn predicated upon the legal ability of some (though not all) individuals to enter into voluntary contracts with one another. The men at the helm of the medieval city-states and those who belonged to the high-ranking guilds were the primary beneficiaries of these new legal doctrines. The poor, slaves, captives, unfree domestic labor, male rural workers, and the vast majority of women remained severely restricted in their contractual autonomy.</p>
<p class="indent">Confronted with the expansion of credit instruments during the commercial revolution of the Middle Ages, jurists and lawyers were tasked with <span title="64" id="calibre_link-1744"></span>
 reconciling the conception of social groups as belonging to a fixed natural hierarchy with the recognition of the freedom of consenting individuals to enter into voluntary commercial agreements with their peers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-679" href="#calibre_link-488" class="calibre6">65</a>
</sup>
 Debates of enormous consequence for the course of European history focusing on the interplay of an individual’s legal status (as defined by birth or, more rarely, through a rite of passage) and his freedom to choose among a broader or narrower set of contractual options infused the legalistic disquisitions that between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries began to redefine the law of obligations on the Continent. During the sixteenth century, a time of rapid demographic and economic growth, the pace of these legal and social transformations accelerated and provoked a crisis of legibility in the market. In this early phase of European globalization, international merchants increasingly operated with “the feather and the sheet of paper,” that is, immaterial payment and credit instruments. They were no longer required to enroll in guilds (unlike artisans) and thus escaped guilds’ supervision.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-680" href="#calibre_link-489" class="calibre6">66</a>
</sup>
 As merchant guilds, the institutions that had traditionally guaranteed the good standing of their members, lost ground, traders involved in transactions across long distances had to resort to other means to prove their good reputation. Rank alone had never been a sufficient metric of credibility, but the expansion of the boundaries of commercial society represented something new: the promise of broader participation in market exchanges and the peril of the indiscriminate mixing of actors using increasingly abstract credit instruments.</p>
<p class="indent">How were investors and entrepreneurs wishing to enter into a voluntary bilateral agreement with someone outside of their immediate circle to verify the integrity and expertise of the contracting party? The legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange, erroneous as it was, provided an answer to this vital and yet intractable question. The legend evoked risks that could not be calculated easily and drew symbolic boundaries in a world in which intangible financial instruments and the erosion of merchants’ corporate status made the impersonality of the market as threatening as it was potentially beneficial.</p>
<p class="indent">On a discursive level, a striking continuity linked the twelfth-century French abbot of Clairvaux to the seventeenth-century lawyer of Bordeaux: the frequent semantic slippage between Jews and untrustworthy creditors in general. Visual and textual examples of this analogy survive in artifacts from the seventeenth-century Spanish Low Countries, where no Jews had resided since the Black Death and where “Lombards” replaced them until 1618. In paintings large and small, Christian moneylenders were depicted with recognizable <span title="65" id="calibre_link-1727"></span>
 “Jewish” attributes.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-681" href="#calibre_link-490" class="calibre6">67</a>
</sup>
 On the level of everyday reality, by the mid-sixteenth century, the notion of “baptized Jews” was as much a lived experience as a metaphor in Bordeaux, since many of the Jews who were fleeing the Iberian inquisitions passed through or settled in the region north of the Pyrenees. Not the world of the ghetto, but the conversion crises of the 1490s, as the next chapter will show, loomed large in the pages of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>

 The next chapters will survey the fate of this narrative&mdash;a fate that surely surpassed its author’s expectations and embedded variants of the original formulation into a chain of intertextual transmission. For now, I wish to illustrate the circumstances in which Cleirac composed his writings. I do so not in the name of the illusion against which Roland Barthes famously protested: “When the Author has been found, the text is ‘explained.’”<sup class="calibre7">

</sup>
 Rather, by immersing the legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange in the time and place in which it was first committed to print, I continue in my effort to recover some of the implicit connections that readers would likely have made at the time and that today elude us.</p>
<p class="indent">Étienne Cleirac (1583&ndash;1657) was born, lived, and died in Bordeaux, where a street is named after him (<a href="#calibre_link-74" class="calibre6">figure 4.1</a>
 ). Then a mid-ranking urban center, Bordeaux was the site of an important humanist secondary school and a law school, a burgeoning Atlantic port and banking center, and one of only two French cities (the other was Metz, annexed to France in 1552) where a Jewish minority resided. Bordeaux’s Jewish minority, however, was unusual in the sense that, unlike Metz’s, it was not openly Jewish. In 1550, the French crown invited “merchants and other Portuguese known as New Christians” to settle in the southwestern region of the kingdom, exempting them from the need to <span title="67" id="calibre_link-1819"></span>
 request naturalization letters. This invitation automatically guaranteed these immigrants’ families the same privileges as all French subjects, including freedom of movement, full property rights, and the ability to conduct any economic activities they wished.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-684" href="#calibre_link-1508" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
 By this measure, “his most Christian majesty,” as the French king was addressed at the time, aimed to inject capital and talent into his trading system. The ordinance’s beneficiaries, though unnamed, were unmistakable: those former Jews who, having been forcibly converted to Catholicism in Spain and Portugal during the 1490s, wished to escape. Even more specifically, the ordinance targeted those New Christians who lived in Portugal, for whom the recent creation of a national inquisition in 1536 constituted a mounting threat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span title="68" id="calibre_link-1656"></span>
 In the mid-sixteenth century, other towns in Europe, including Florence, Ferrara, and Antwerp, also welcomed New Christians in spite of the Catholic Church’s objection to leniency toward baptized Jews, whom Rome regarded as prone to living secretly as Jews in defiance of the sanctity of baptism. But this type of accommodation was short-lived. By the 1590s, secular authorities preferred to invite Iberian émigrés to settle in their territories as Jews, rather than as New Christians, in order to dispel any residual ambiguity surrounding their religious identity. As a result, new Sephardic Jewish communities were established in Venice, Livorno, Hamburg, and Amsterdam. In Bordeaux, however, the institutional arrangement devised in 1550 continued for more than a century and a half. The absence of any modern inquisition tribunal in France allowed for the emergence of a regime of toleration in which crypto-Judaism was an open secret. The theological notion of “baptized Jews” thus found its most lasting institutional incarnation outside of Iberia in southwestern France. While few in number, “Portuguese merchants” were overrepresented among Bordeaux’s international traders and well established in certain manufacturing sectors (silk and Moroccan leather in particular), local retail markets, and the medical profession.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-685" href="#calibre_link-1509" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
 For all the reasons we have recounted, New Christians’ concealed religious identity not only troubled religious authorities but also heightened fears that behind any reputable merchant might lurk a “Jewish usurer.”</p>
<p class="indent">The consolidation of the Portuguese community in Bordeaux after the Wars of Religion (1562&ndash;1598) coincided with a period of economic and legal changes that tested the traditional division in Old Regime French society between noblemen and merchants. Historians have written extensively on the venality of France’s legal and administrative offices, first institutionalized under Francis I (r. 1515&ndash;1547), and on the creation of the “nobility of the robe” (as opposed to the “nobility of the sword”), a title and idea that undermined genealogical conceptions of nobility.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-686" href="#calibre_link-1510" class="calibre6">5</a>

 They have also dissected the appearance of “merit” in the aristocratic language of the seventeenth century and the need to reconcile merit with deep-seated notions of lineage and the hereditary quality of “honor.”<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent"><span title="69" id="calibre_link-1789"></span>
 We know much less about the changing legal and cultural status of commerce in the seventeenth century, especially during its first half, before Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who served as Louis XIV’s controller-general of finance from 1665 until his death in 1683, initiated a series of consequential reforms. Idiosyncratic as they are, Cleirac’s writings afford us a unique entry point into this transformative and yet neglected phase of French history, offering the view of a sympathetic but distressed participant-observer at a time when ongoing economic changes and the crown’s political ambitions were putting pressure on long-held ideas about the place of commerce in a well-ordered corporate society. The meaning of the word “merchant” had evolved over the years: it no longer exclusively denoted someone affiliated with a guild but referred to anyone who carried out a range of commercial transactions. As a result, both noblemen and Jews could be designated as merchants. New symbolic hierarchies, Cleirac implies, had to be erected as legal ones were being eroded.</p>
<p class="indent">After graduating from the Collège de Guyenne, one of the kingdom’s most renowned humanist secondary schools (both Michel de Montaigne and Joseph Scaliger had been educated there), Cleirac studied law and spent the rest of his life working as a barrister (<em class="calibre4">avocat</em>
 ) at the royal appellate court (<em class="calibre4">parlement</em>
 ) of Bordeaux and, briefly, as a royal legal official (<em class="calibre4">procureur du roy</em>
 ) in the city’s admiralty (<a href="#calibre_link-75" class="calibre6">figure 4.2</a>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">

 In 1616 he acquired the status of <em class="calibre4">bourgeois</em>
 , a title that at the time granted not only social recognition but also fiscal exemptions, and two years later he married.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-689" href="#calibre_link-1513" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
 While many in his profession embraced the Calvinist faith, Cleirac remained fiercely Catholic and monarchist, whether out of conviction or necessity. His professional career suffered from his son’s prominent involvement in the Ormée (1651&ndash;1653), Bordeaux’s radical arm of the Fronde, which rallied many artisans, merchants, lawyers, low-ranking magistrates, and a few clergymen to revolt against the monarchy.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-690" href="#calibre_link-1514" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
 Forced to retreat to his residence in the countryside as a result of his son’s activities, Cleirac immersed himself in reading and writing. At the time of his death, he had amassed a vast collection of 671 books.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-691" href="#calibre_link-1515" class="calibre6">10</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Unusually for a man of his time and background, Cleirac turned his attention not to the <em class="calibre4">ius commune</em>
 or the French <em class="calibre4">coutumes</em>
 , subjects that animated both theorists and critics of absolutism, but to maritime law. He approached the topic from a stance steeped in humanistic learning and Roman law but also armed with firsthand experience, having participated in complex deliberations involving shipowners, captains, sailors, merchants, and underwriters. Probably driven by self-promotion, he aimed to produce a text that would be of practical use to judges and administrators. Today virtually unknown outside a small <span title="70" id="calibre_link-1858"></span>

 An arcane and specialized subject, then as now, maritime law in the early seventeenth century overlapped with multiple spheres of knowledge, life, and government. It was not a topic of instruction in law schools, but since the mid-sixteenth century it had generated a few important scholarly treatments, which served as guides to magistrates who adjudicated commercial and financial litigation. Meanwhile, the growing centrality of overseas trade in the international system of great powers put maritime and commercial law squarely at the center of emerging interstate and domestic politics.</p>

 the peculiar composition of Bordeaux’s commercial society that Cleirac included the legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange in his commentary on Rouen’s rules of marine insurance.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nothing like <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 &mdash;a vernacular publication that assembled, translated, and commented on legal norms of maritime trade developed in western and northern Europe since the twelfth century&mdash;existed in Europe when it first appeared in Bordeaux in 1647.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-693" href="#calibre_link-1517" class="calibre6">12</a>

 Judging by its publication record, it filled a void. Printed in-quarto (roughly 10 × 8 inches), the 1647 edition is a voluminous text of 576 pages, plus index and appendices. An expanded version appeared in Bordeaux in 1661 in a print run of at least 1,200 copies, an extraordinarily high run for any nonreligious book, and all the more so for one devoted to maritime law.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-694" href="#calibre_link-1518" class="calibre6">13</a>

 For purposes of comparison, consider that in 1528, the first edition of Baldassare Castiglione’s <em class="calibre4">Courtier</em>

<a id="calibre_link-696" href="#calibre_link-1519" class="calibre6">14</a>

 Print runs grew over time, but in the early seventeenth century it was still rare for more than 1,000 copies of nonreligious books to be printed; publishers only made some 2,000 to 3,000 copies of certain dictionaries and Roman or canon law compilations.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">The 1661 edition of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>

 The choice to publish the work in the vernacular set Cleirac apart from other jurists and proved a recipe for success, albeit one that largely bypassed him, since he died four years before the second edition went to press. Until the appearance of Jean-Marie Pardessus’s monumental compilation in the mid-nineteenth century, <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 was the single most comprehensive collection of European maritime laws published in the vernacular.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-699" href="#calibre_link-1521" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The volume is divided into three sections. The first comprises the Judgments of Oléron, the Laws of Wisby, and the rules of the Hanseatic League from 1591, which Cleirac incorrectly dates to 1597 (although the mistake is perhaps simply due to a typographical error). The second section focuses on marine insurance, reproducing the <em class="calibre4">Guidon de la mer</em>
 as well as the norms on marine insurance promulgated by Philip II in Antwerp in 1563 (inaccurately dated to 1593) and an ordinance published in Amsterdam in 1598, together with <span title="72" id="calibre_link-1683"></span>
 the relevant formulas. Finally, the third section consists of a redacted and copiously annotated assemblage of French royal ordinances pertaining to internal and seaborne navigation in times of war and peace issued between 1400 and 1584. It expands, reorganizes, and comments on all decrees concerning the jurisdiction of the admiralty of France listed in the most extensive collection of French royal ordinances to date, the so-called “Code Henri,” after King Henry III (r. 1574&ndash;1589), who had commissioned it.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-700" href="#calibre_link-1522" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
 At the end of the volume, Cleirac appends an earlier minor work, <em class="calibre4">Explication des termes de marine</em>
 (1636), a short text that belonged to the emerging genre of maritime and naval dictionaries and contained a rudimentary glossary of terms pertaining to maritime trade and contracts, followed by a description of flags used by ships of different states.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-701" href="#calibre_link-1523" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Only the book’s first section was translated into English in 1686, when it appeared as <em class="calibre4">The Ancient Sea-laws of Oleron, Wisby and the Hanse-towns Still in Force</em>
 and was immediately reprinted together with Gerard Malynes’s <em class="calibre4">Consuetudo, vel Lex Mercatoria, or, The Ancient Law-Merchant</em>
 (first published in 1622), one of the most popular English-language merchant manuals of the period.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-702" href="#calibre_link-1076" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
 The English translation omitted the <em class="calibre4">Guidon de la mer</em>
 , and thus Cleirac’s commentary that featured the pseudo-historical narrative of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange. The omission was logical, since the Judgments of Oléron, the contested authorship of which elicited competing patriotic accounts from French and English writers, and the Laws of Wisby, which influenced the rules of Dutch and Baltic navigation, were the most interesting texts edited by Cleirac for English-speaking readers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-703" href="#calibre_link-1524" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
 This editorial choice, however, affected the legend’s reception in England (<a href="#calibre_link-137" class="calibre6">chapter 7</a>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">The seven pages of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 that recount when and why Jews invented marine insurance and bills of exchange and how misguided Christian bankers adopted those credit instruments are unusually unwieldy. All of Cleirac’s commentaries, however, juxtapose predictable and legitimate sources with more improbable ones. The result is a mishmash of citations from the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the writings of greater and lesser Roman and Greek authors, Church Fathers, saints, theologians, antiquarians, geographers, medieval chroniclers, towering humanists like Gerolamo Cardano and Scaliger, novelists and poets like Dante, Boccaccio, and Ariosto, and historians like Nicole Gilles and Étienne Pasquier, as well as collections of proverbs and travelers’ accounts. Only when he added citations from the Qur’an and <em class="calibre4">The Prophecies of Merlin</em>
 to the second edition did Cleirac feel compelled to explain that he chose to include the works of such “ignorant and ridiculous” <span title="73" id="calibre_link-1637"></span>
 authors not because he believed their superstitions but because they were their own worst enemies, in the sense that they could not hide their fallacies.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">The eclecticism of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 gives it a flavor of dilettantism and has earned its author a mixed reputation among modern specialists, yet this characteristic was arguably one of the primary ingredients of its appeal. The work translated and digested for a broad reading public concerns about the world of commerce that were located at the intersection of law, theology, humanism, and practical merchant culture. At least one person studied the book sufficiently seriously to compile a (generally accurate) printed list of all the authors cited in it (<a href="#calibre_link-76" class="calibre6">figure 4.3</a>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-705" href="#calibre_link-1526" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 was and remains difficult to classify. A nearly exact contemporary of Hugo Grotius (1583&ndash;1645), Cleirac lacked that scholar’s original mind and eloquence. He drew from established models of legal scholarship, but the muddled nature of his annotations departs from the rigor of Latin treatises on commercial and maritime law by jurists like the Anconetan Benvenuto Stracca, the Portuguese Pedro de Santarém, the Roman Sigismondo Scaccia, and the Genoese Raffaele della Torre, not to mention Grotius and his rival John Selden.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-706" href="#calibre_link-1527" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 More than any of those treatises, <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 abounds in practical instructions, examples of contracts, and moralizing tales about credit, yet it is neither a merchant handbook nor a confessor manual. Leaning on his training, Cleirac repeatedly references Roman law, jurisprudence, and French regional customs. And while he turns regularly to prominent legal scholars like Andrea Alciato (1492&ndash;1550), Charles du Moulin (1500&ndash;1566), Jacques Cujas (1522&ndash;1590), and Charles Loyseau (1566&ndash;1627), he does not disdain more modest French jurists and lawyers with expertise in local statutes and customs.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-707" href="#calibre_link-1528" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac’s sparing use of practical or normative books about trade is symptomatic of his position as a half-removed observer of the world of maritime trade. The list of his citations from this genre is short even if we consider that he wrote before Jacques Savary produced his masterpiece in 1675 (<a href="#calibre_link-298" class="calibre6">chapter 5</a>
 ); it is limited to the works of Jean Trenchant, Juan de Hevia Bolaños, Mathias Maréschal, Peter Peck, and Pedro de Santarém, as well as the sentences of the Genoese Rota.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-708" href="#calibre_link-1529" class="calibre6">26</a>
</sup>
 While he quotes Italian poets and playwrights, Cleirac makes no reference to the robust Italian literature on commerce and exchange dealing that was widely accessible at the time. There is no mention of Bernardo Davanzati’s treatises on bills of exchange, Giovanni Domenico Peri’s merchant manual, or even Benedetto Cotrugli’s <em class="calibre4">Della mercatura</em>
 , which had been translated into French. The absence of these Italian classics helps explain why Cleirac attributes to medieval Jews, rather than to Florentines, as Cotrugli did, the invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">

 In spite of its inaccuracies and distortions, readers flocked to <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 . At the time of its publication, maritime law was attracting the increasing attention of statesmen, publishers, scholars, and practitioners alike. In the 1570s, a merchant from Marseilles, Guillaume Giraud, had commissioned the translation and printing of Barcelona’s <em class="calibre4">Libre del consolat de mar</em>
 (composed around 1340 and first printed in Catalan in 1494), the best-known medieval collection of maritime customs from southern Europe.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-710" href="#calibre_link-1530" class="calibre6">28</a>
</sup>
 In the 1620s and 1630s, preeminent man of letters Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc (1580&ndash;1637) displayed more than a passing interest in maritime law in his wide-ranging inquiries into overseas trade.<sup class="calibre7">

 The aggressive military policies pursued by Cardinal Armand du Plessis, Duke of Richelieu and chief minister of the French crown from 1624 to 1642, required that France defend its prerogatives over the sea, especially in the English Channel and the Mediterranean. An expansive treatise published in Latin in 1643 by Claude Barthélemy de Morisot (1592&ndash;1661), of which Cleirac makes use, outlined the evolution of maritime and commercial law and articulated a distinctive synthesis of the doctrines of <em class="calibre4">mare liberum</em>
 (the right to free circulation on the high seas) and <em class="calibre4">mare clausum</em>
 (a state’s sovereignty over the sea).<sup class="calibre7">

</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This literature was as much the result of emerging political and intellectual concerns as a response to specific incidents at sea that demanded that state officials be given new legal weapons with which to embark on elaborate diplomatic negotiations. In 1627, one of these potentially explosive events endangered relations between France and Spain at a delicate moment. Years later, when he sat down to compile <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 , Cleirac still had a vivid memory of his involvement in this tragic incident.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2057">Crisis on the Guyenne Shore</h3>
<p class="noindent">In mid-January 1627, two enormous Portuguese cargo ships, the <em class="calibre4">São Bartolomeu</em>
 and the <em class="calibre4">Santa Helena</em>
 , as well as five of the six armed galleons that escorted them, sank in the Bay of Biscay (<a href="#calibre_link-77" class="calibre6">figures 4.4</a>
 and <a href="#calibre_link-78" class="calibre6">4.5</a>
 ). A survivor called the naval disaster the greatest loss Portugal had sustained since the time of King Sebastian&mdash;a comparison that was not meant lightly, given how largely the loss of independence that followed the death of King Sebastian in 1578 loomed in the Portuguese imagination.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-713" href="#calibre_link-1533" class="calibre6">31</a>

 In the winter of 1627, the royal convoy was returning to Lisbon, as it did every year, from Goa, the capital of the Portuguese Empire in India, to discharge its precious cargo of spices, ivory, ebony, ceramics, wax, coconut, silk, Chinese wooden cabinets, Indian cotton textiles, precious stones, ambergris, bezoar, and other prized imports from Asia, Ethiopia, and the interior of Africa. Exact figures for the 1627 losses differ from one source to another, but all of the numbers provided are staggering. Perhaps as many as 2,000 men perished, including high-ranking noblemen, and only 215 members of the crew survived. The total cargo was valued at between 6 and 8 million ducats&mdash;an extraordinary sum that equaled the official value of all annual imports from Spanish America in that same year.</p>

 The timing and location of the shipwreck could not have been less propitious for Richelieu. Earlier that January, he had begun to deploy his diplomatic talent to persuade the king of Spain, Philip IV, to lend him military aid against the English and the Huguenots at La Rochelle.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-714" href="#calibre_link-1534" class="calibre6">32</a>
</sup>
 Now Philip IV demanded the return of the spoils of the wreckage that were turning up along the beaches of southwestern France. In seeking to comply with the request, the cardinal discovered the limits of his own domestic power. That peasants and villagers looted whatever they found was only part of the problem. Royal legislation in matters of wrecks (<em class="calibre4">droit de bris et naufrage</em>
 ) assigned a third of all unclaimed recovered goods to those who salvaged them, a third to the admiral of France (a role that Richelieu had recently assumed), and a third either to the king or to local feudal lords.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-715" href="#calibre_link-1535" class="calibre6">33</a>
</sup>
 The latter provision was the vestige of an old customary right (<em class="calibre4">le droict de coste</em>
 , or <em class="calibre4">varech</em>
 in Normandy). It was to this right that the powerful governor of Guyenne, Jean-Louis Nogaret de La Valette, duc d’Épernon (1544&ndash;1642), appealed when claiming possession of several diamonds that washed ashore and obstructing the cardinal’s initiatives.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to sort out these legal controversies and placate both domestic and foreign stakeholders, Richelieu sent two envoys to the region, first Fran-çois de Fortia and then Abel de Servien.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-716" href="#calibre_link-1536" class="calibre6">34</a>
</sup>
 Cleirac was then the chief legal appointee (<em class="calibre4">procureur du roy</em>
 ) at the admiralty of Bordeaux, which adjudicated conflicts over shipwrecks and maritime trade, and in that capacity assisted Fortia and Servien (he later used his privileged access to admiralty documents when composing <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-717" href="#calibre_link-1537" class="calibre6">35</a>
</sup>
 Meanwhile, Richelieu also charged a learned member of the Parisian republic of letters, Théodore Godefroy (1580&ndash;1649), with assembling the existing doctrine and jurisprudence concerning the law of wreck. By the time Godefroy handed in his report in January 1630, the dispute had been resolved and Richelieu was absorbed by the War of Mantua Succession. As a result, to this day, Godefroy’s work remains unpublished.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-718" href="#calibre_link-1538" class="calibre6">36</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike Godefroy, Cleirac took to writing on his own initiative, seeing his work as a tool of social affirmation. He seems never to have been in Paris, never to have corresponded with the capital’s literati, and never to have joined any of the kingdom’s emerging scholarly academies. Isolated even in his own Bordeaux, he poured his energies into compiling <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 . To redeem his reputation from the scandal provoked by his son’s leadership in the Ormée, he peppered the work with laudatory remarks about Richelieu (who did not live long enough to see it). But he accomplished much more than rehabilitating his image. The law of wreck exposed the patchwork nature of <span title="79" id="calibre_link-1702"></span>
 French absolutism, tying the hands of the monarch.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-719" href="#calibre_link-1539" class="calibre6">37</a>
</sup>
 Cleirac offered theorists and administrators of royal rights useful legal weapons and an elegant justification of their prerogatives in matters of wreckage. He highlighted the edicts that Richelieu had issued in the wake of the 1627 disaster, which strengthened the position of the crown vis à vis coastal lords, and cast these edicts’ protection of the property rights of seagoers as a civilizing mission against the “cruelty” of earlier times, when wreckages of naval disasters were invariably pillaged.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-720" href="#calibre_link-924" class="calibre6">38</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Two sets of debris became the object of particularly tense negotiations in the aftermath of the Bay of Biscay disaster: cannons and diamonds. Pressing needs added to the perennial military value of artillery. In May 1627 Richelieu began to mount preparations for the siege of the Huguenot bastion of La Rochelle, which was attacked throughout the summer and capitulated in October of the following year. His emissaries in Bordeaux raked up all military equipment in the region, while the local population felt aggravated by the mobilization. With the cooperation of some local lords, the royal envoys succeeded in recovering about fifty cannons from the naval wreckage that negotiations with Spain allowed them to retain for the purpose of attacking La Rochelle. Governor d’Épernon was less obliging with regard to some of the precious stones that had survived the wreck. He had acquired a large castle on the Garonne through marriage, which gave him seigniorial rights over a stretch of the coast of Médoc, and the Spanish envoy accused him of hiding diamonds in his castle.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-721" href="#calibre_link-1540" class="calibre6">39</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Richelieu, in other words, had to negotiate on two fronts for the recovery of the goods that had come ashore in January 1627: with Spain on the one hand, and with his own regional governor and a few recalcitrant lords on the other. Diamonds and precious stones added complications of their own. Shipwrecks eroded what one historian has called the “wall of secrecy” that Portuguese merchants built around the intercontinental trade of precious stones, a trade in which New Christians participated in great numbers and that often involved smuggling.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-722" href="#calibre_link-1541" class="calibre6">40</a>
</sup>
 According to an official list, diamonds and other stones made up 18.5 percent of the declared value of the cargo of the <em class="calibre4">São Bartolomeu</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">Santa Helena</em>
 , or slightly more than the 14 percent average that the same historian estimated to be the fraction of this merchandise on board all Portuguese vessels returning from India between 1580 and 1640.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-723" href="#calibre_link-1542" class="calibre6">41</a>
</sup>
 One diamond listed among the 1627 cargo was a gift to the Spanish queen from the king of Bijapur. All the other stones, unlike pepper and spices in general, which were subject to the Portuguese crown’s monopoly, were the legitimate property of private merchants, who were allowed to transport them in so-called “liberty <span title="80" id="calibre_link-1647"></span>
 boxes.” Many of these private merchants were descendants of baptized Jews. By one estimation, in 1630 Lisbon’s principal New Christian merchant families controlled about 80 percent of the registered private merchandise on board the <em class="calibre4">carreira da Índia</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-724" href="#calibre_link-1543" class="calibre6">42</a>
</sup>
 Though inevitably imprecise, this figure points to a phenomenon that caught contemporaries’ attention, in part, to be sure, because of the tendency of Christian observers (and some modern scholars too) to inflate Jewish economic influence.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of the disaster along the coast of Guyenne, both French and Spanish authorities sought to conceal the involvement of New Christian traders and financiers in order to protect their own and those traders’ interests. The French crown officially tolerated the presence of “Portuguese merchants” in the southwestern part of the kingdom as long as they renounced all traces of their Jewish identity. For his part, Spain’s chief minister, Count-Duke Olivares, was particularly attentive to the interests of New Christian financiers. Shortly after the shipwreck, on January 31, 1627, he declared state bankruptcy, suspended payments to long-standing Genoese creditors, and replaced most of them with Portuguese lenders. This move inaugurated the fifteen-year golden age of New Christian banking in Madrid, which lasted until (and contributed to) Olivares’s demise in 1643.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-725" href="#calibre_link-1544" class="calibre6">43</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In February 1628, Richelieu prevailed over d’Épernon and promised to return the recovered goods to Spain, but inquiries to determine property rights continued. Given the investigations conducted by the Spanish Inquisition and the hostility of common folk in the French coastal villages toward Spaniards and Jews, it is not surprising that only a thin and oblique paper trail of the New Christians’ ownership of the diamonds on board the sunken ships and those individuals’ possible role in the recovery operations exists among government records. Unfortunately, private business papers have not survived. Here and there, however, official documents mention, albeit <em class="calibre4">sotto voce</em>
 , a host of Iberian <em class="calibre4">conversos</em>
 from Bordeaux and Paris who facilitated the efforts to retrieve the merchandise by transmitting information and anticipating the sums needed to ransom the goods from looters. They included a “Portuguese” named Diego da Costa, a Castilian merchant in Bordeaux named Antonio Enrique, a Portuguese merchant in Paris named Enrique Alvarez (“portugues de nación, mercader en Paris”), and the enigmatic informer of Richelieu and diamond dealer Alphonse Lopez.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-726" href="#calibre_link-1545" class="calibre6">44</a>
</sup>
 Frustrated by the slowness of the salvage and restitution process, the Spanish royal envoy suggested that “the Portuguese merchants who reside in Bordeaux” could help expedite the mission.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-727" href="#calibre_link-1546" class="calibre6">45</a>
</sup>
 These and other <span title="81" id="calibre_link-1733"></span>
 clues have led the authors of a study of the 1627 shipwreck to conclude that Portuguese New Christians were “the most secret protagonists, and possibly the most powerful ones” in the story.<sup class="calibre7">

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2058">New Christians, Crypto-Jews, and New Jews in Bordeaux</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although Cleirac makes no explicit reference to New Christian merchants, there can be no doubt that he met some of them in the course of his life in Bordeaux, whether in the classroom, in the now-demolished Palais de l’Ombrière (then the site of the admiralty court), or even in his parish church. Questions of religious conflict and toleration were then the subject of daily negotiation in a region that had become a bulwark of Protestantism and the destination of Jewish refugees from Iberia. The Collège de Guyenne, which Cleirac attended in his youth, had been co-founded by a Portuguese New Christian, André Govea, attracted both local and Iberian pupils, and included several teachers and students of Huguenot confession. After the <em class="calibre4">parlement</em>
 of Bordeaux ratified the Edict of Nantes in 1599, Calvinist students were excused from the requirement of signing the cross at the beginning of classes. Cleirac’s classmates thus comprised both professing Catholics of Jewish descent and openly practicing Calvinists.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-729" href="#calibre_link-1548" class="calibre6">47</a>
</sup>
 At the same time, the ritualistic or sacramental nature of the Eucharist remained a lightning rod in theological disputes that were no less explosive in Bordeaux than elsewhere.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-730" href="#calibre_link-1549" class="calibre6">48</a>
</sup>
 And it was in Bordeaux that in 1643 the heterodox Calvinist scholar Isaac La Peyrère anonymously published his unusual appeal to the French king to join forces with the Jews in order to hasten the coming of a Judeo-Christian messianic age.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-731" href="#calibre_link-1550" class="calibre6">49</a>
</sup>

<p class="indent">Since 1550, Bordeaux and the smaller town of Bayonne, located along the Franco-Spanish border, as well as outposts in the interior like Bidache and Peyrehorade, had served as temporary stops for many New Christian families fleeing the Iberian inquisitions and for some had become permanent homes. In line with its conception of Gallican liberties, the French crown had been able to choose a form of accommodation for the exiled that its Catholic competitors on the Italian peninsula, all regional states that hosted a branch of the Roman Inquisition, had been forced to reject as too destabilizing. Between 1589 and 1593, the rulers of Venice and Livorno created incentives for Jews of Iberian descent, all of whom had been baptized as infants, to embrace Judaism (with all the restrictions that that choice entailed) in exchange for protection from the accusation of apostasy, a charge that could be fatal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="82" id="calibre_link-1734"></span>
 In Bordeaux, by contrast, it was not until 1723 that the crown allowed the open practice of Judaism in the region, and so until then Portuguese and Spanish merchants were asked to live and die as good Catholics: they married in church, baptized their children, and buried their loved ones in Catholic cemeteries. Their inner feelings are lost to us, while their religious practices ranged from sincere Catholicism to syncretic crypto-Judaism. The tenor of municipal ordinances from this period admonishing those who harassed “Portuguese merchants” suggests that the label remained a euphemism for much of the local population, with many regarding these individuals as impious and less than welcome.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">The crown’s interest in protecting New Christians was rooted in the expectation that they would contribute to the growth of Bordeaux’s international trade. The 1550 decree that invited “Portuguese merchants” to settle in the region exempted them from the punitive <em class="calibre4">droit d’aubaine</em>
 , the king’s right to confiscate the assets of any foreigner who died on French soil.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-733" href="#calibre_link-1552" class="calibre6">51</a>

 These immigrants were thus styled as naturalized French subjects with full property rights. The measure paid off. In 1636, by official count, Bordeaux had 260 Portuguese and Spanish residents, although they constituted less than 1 percent of the city’s population, estimated at 30,000&ndash;35,000.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-734" href="#calibre_link-1553" class="calibre6">52</a>
</sup>
 With the rise of Bordeaux into a major hub of Atlantic trade in the eighteenth century, the New Christian population also expanded, increasing by midcentury to roughly 1,500 Iberian immigrants (or more than 2 percent of the inhabitants of a town that by then had some 65,000 residents), with the richest among them living next to affluent Catholic merchants in the Chartrons neighborhood in the northern section of the city.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-735" href="#calibre_link-1554" class="calibre6">53</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Both rival merchants hostile to Jews and royal authorities intent on protecting the Portuguese newcomers likely exaggerated the New Christians’ economic influence, albeit for opposite reasons. It is, however, indisputable that, while never a dominant economic group, the New Christians stood out for their commercial dynamism. In 1675, Bordeaux’s municipal government (<em class="calibre4">jurade</em>
 ) pleaded with Colbert for protection of the city’s Portuguese merchants, who were threatening to leave Bordeaux on account of riots that were endangering their trade. Their departure, the local authorities feared, would inflict great losses on the city.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-736" href="#calibre_link-1555" class="calibre6">54</a>

 In 1686, the chief royal officer (<em class="calibre4">intendant</em>
 ) in Guyenne, Louis Bazin de Bezons, advised against imposing a special tax on New Christians and urged them not to emigrate while also reminding them of the necessity of living as Old Catholics (<em class="calibre4">anciens catholiques</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-737" href="#calibre_link-1556" class="calibre6">55</a>

 Between 1718 and 1722, another crown official (<em class="calibre4">sous-intendant</em>
 ) defended Jews’ reputation <span title="83" id="calibre_link-1658"></span>
 against a complaint submitted to the Chamber of Commerce that lamented their supposed monopoly on the brokerage of bills of exchange: without Jews, the official maintained, commerce in the region would perish.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">The Franco-Spanish border was easy to cross along the Atlantic shoreline. This geographical reality had both religious and economic consequences. New Christian families with fluid religious identities lived on both sides of the frontier.<sup class="calibre7">

 At the expiration of the Twelve Years’ Truce between Spain and the United Provinces (1609&ndash;1621), when trade between the two countries was made illegal once again, southwestern France became a strategic area for the smuggling of goods between the Iberian Peninsula and northern Europe and its colonial markets. New Christians from the region became heavily involved in both lawful and illicit trade with the Sephardic community of Amsterdam.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-740" href="#calibre_link-1559" class="calibre6">58</a>

 Inquisition records offer biased but valuable information about these relationships. Many of those whom the tribunal of Lisbon tried for apostasy after finding that they had resided in southwestern France during the seventeenth century were involved in commercial activities, and are described in records as <em class="calibre4">comerciante</em>

<p class="indent">Once the Spanish Inquisition resumed its crackdown on presumed crypto-Jews in the 1630s and 1640s, it was quick to find many of them on the French side of the border, including a sizable group in Rouen.<sup class="calibre7">

 During his interrogation in 1637, the Portuguese merchant Juan Núñes Saraiva admitted to following the Jewish rites “as they are observed in France” and confessed that he had lured a rabbi from Holland to Bordeaux so that his father could be circumcised before he died there.<sup class="calibre7">

 After the open practice of Judaism was permitted in Bordeaux in 1723, Parisian merchants jealous of the Jews of Bordeaux’s success accused them of “a double apostasy”: in Portugal, they were Jews turned Christians; in France, they were Christians turned Jews.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">Arguments used in favor of and against the presence of “Portuguese merchants” in Bordeaux suggest that Cleirac’s vision of Jews was nurtured in an environment in which New Christians were perceived as the embodiment of economic prowess and slippery religious identity. France’s geographical proximity to Spain and the repeated wars between the two countries (in Cleirac’s lifetime alone, such conflicts occurred in 1595&ndash;1598, 1628&ndash;1631, and 1635&ndash;1659) added a political dimension to the traditional motifs of Christian anti-Jewish <span title="84" id="calibre_link-1670"></span>
 sentiments. Even in peacetime, a counselor to the French king denounced all Portuguese residents of southwestern France as traitors.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">Fears that Jews and Christians could become indistinguishable permeated European Christian culture at large during this period. The regime of toleration that prevailed in seventeenth-century Bordeaux heightened rather than quelled fears about the porousness of the boundaries between Jews and Christians. There, more than in any other city of the kingdom, a small but proactive group of New Christian merchants was at once visible and invisible. Whether valued or condemned, their economic activities were not confined to a separate corporate body, with its own place in the hierarchical society of the time. They walked the same docks as other merchants and sat in the same church pews as other Catholics. For Cleirac and his readers, the lack of precise boundaries between Jews and non-Jews mirrored the erosion of age-old divisions between merchants and noblemen at a time when a major restructuring of the legal and social order, and the place of commerce within it, was underway in France.</p>

<p class="noindent">The frontispiece of Cleirac’s 1647 edition of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>

The motto “Potent over sea and over land” accompanies the coat of arms of Anne of Austria, the regent queen of France from 1643 to 1651 (during the minority of Louis XIV), to whom the book is dedicated (<a href="#calibre_link-79" class="calibre6">figure 4.6</a>

 France was then entering the competitive arena of European commercial expansion and overseas territorial conquest. Maritime law was an essential tool of this expanding international politics. At home, interest in this branch of law was inseparable from broader concerns about the reordering of social hierarchies. Cleirac points to these broader concerns in his dedication, in which he lays out two reasons for assembling his compilation: the wish to furnish judges of ordinary courts like him, with little or no direct experience of maritime trade, with a reference book that would assist them in adjudicating disputes in matters of navigation; and the desire to elevate the reputation of all people working at sea (“fils de Neptune”), so that instead of being regarded as unrefined and loath-some (“grossiers et méprisables”), they could acquire the dignity accorded to those working the land (“fils de la Terre”).<sup class="calibre7">

 Cleirac was not alone in his desire to enhance the respectability of “Neptune’s sons.” His contribution, however, is notable for its early date and for its emphasis on maritime law. When examining the corrosive effects of commerce on traditional concepts of honor and nobility, scholars of Old Regime France have focused on the debates on luxury and the so-called “commercial nobility” that became incendiary in the mid-eighteenth century. Shifting the attention to an earlier moment, Amalia Kessler illuminates the importance of the legal reforms that accompanied these debates, particularly those initiated by Colbert in the administration of commercial justice. One such reform, in which Colbert made all individuals involved in commercial transactions, regardless of their rank, accountable before merchant tribunals, was nothing less than epochal. In the jurisprudential terminology of the time, the 1673 <em class="calibre4">ordonnance de commerce</em>
 turned commercial law from a personal-status law (<em class="calibre4">ratione personae</em>
 ) into a subject-matter law (<em class="calibre4">ratione materiae</em>
 ), that is, into a body of norms and procedures that applied not to a legally defined group (whoever was categorized as a merchant) but to everyone who entered into a specific set of contracts (those regulated by the ordinance itself).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-753" href="#calibre_link-1571" class="calibre6">70</a>
</sup>
 Needless to say, French commercial society was not suddenly transformed into a contractual society as a result of a royal edict. But historians have focused more on the protracted resistance to this innovation, whether by noblemen or by rival courts, than on its significance for the formation of a commercial society that downplayed, at least formally, the importance of personal status.</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac’s writings are better understood in relation to these developments, which trace their origins to a royal edict of November 1563 that established a specialized merchant tribunal (<em class="calibre4">juridiction consulaire</em>
 ) in Paris, following earlier experiments with courts at commercial fairs in other cities of the kingdom, notably Lyon.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-754" href="#calibre_link-1572" class="calibre6">71</a>
</sup>
 Only a year later, the same institution existed in all major French cities, and Bordeaux had elected its first <em class="calibre4">juges-consuls</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-755" href="#calibre_link-1573" class="calibre6">72</a>
</sup>
 By 1710, there were fifty such tribunals across the kingdom, with twenty more created in that year.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-756" href="#calibre_link-1574" class="calibre6">73</a>
</sup>
 These courts were presided over by one head judge and four elected consuls, all of whom were merchants, native subjects of the French crown, residents of the city where the tribunal operated, and elected by an assembly of peers. These <em class="calibre4">juges-consuls</em>
 were ordered to decide cases without charging any fees, with minimal recourse to lawyers or other legal experts, and with fast and summary proceedings (“sommairement &amp; sans figure de procès”) that stood in contrast to those of the civil courts, which were frequently decried <span title="87" id="calibre_link-1805"></span>
 for their length, intricacy, and cost. The <em class="calibre4">juridictions consulaires</em>
 relied primarily on merchants’ oral testimonies and admitted only certain written evidence (such as merchants’ declarations of what constituted standard practice in any given time and place).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-757" href="#calibre_link-1575" class="calibre6">74</a>
</sup>
 Rapid and cheap, this procedure was designed to lower the costs of administering and obtaining justice in the realm of commerce.</p>
<p class="indent">The 1563 edict took pains to define the jurisdictional purview of the newly created courts: the <em class="calibre4">juges-consuls</em>
 were to adjudicate “disputes that from now on will arise between merchants, solely for what pertains to commercial matters, between their widows (when the latter are publicly known as merchants), their employees, and their agents,” as long as the litigation concerned obligations, receipts, bills of exchange, insurance, debts, and partnership agreements (art. 3).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-758" href="#calibre_link-1576" class="calibre6">75</a>
</sup>
 Merchant courts had no authority over matters pertaining to bankruptcy, navigation (a subject delegated to the admiralty courts), and existing fair courts, including those of Lyon.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-759" href="#calibre_link-1577" class="calibre6">76</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In its original conception, then, the <em class="calibre4">jurisdiction consulaire</em>
 was a corporate tribunal, just another piece in the jurisdictional tapestry of Old Regime privileges: it carved out a sphere of autonomy for merchants and bankers within clearly demarcated boundaries. In practice, however, the 1563 edict altered the status quo because of the growing range of people who utilized credit instruments that were once the prerogative of professional merchants. A century after their creation, in 1651, an informed commentator wrote that merchant tribunals had jurisdiction over all disputes over bills of exchange regardless of the “quality” of the persons involved, including clergymen or noblemen.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-760" href="#calibre_link-1578" class="calibre6">77</a>
</sup>
 The observation was technically inaccurate but speaks to the ambiguity generated by the legal and social transformations that were underway in the realm of commercial credit. In 1675, a rare voice among the clergy argued that lending at interest fulfilled a particularly “pure and Christian function” when it allowed those who were not merchants “to live honorably in their condition.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-761" href="#calibre_link-1579" class="calibre6">78</a>
</sup>
 Confusing as these comments may appear, they show that many people in the mid-seventeenth century were grappling with the promise and disruption that credit was bringing to traditional ways of life.</p>
<p class="indent">The ambiguity surrounding commercial tribunals’ jurisdictional boundaries engendered prolonged battles with rival civil courts&mdash;an important subject that scholars have yet to fully illuminate. Nowhere were these battles more strenuously fought than in Lyon, a hub of international finance and silk manufacturing, where in 1463 the king had created a court, the <em class="calibre4">Conservation des privileges royaux des foires</em>
 , tasked with settling disputes among merchants attending <span title="88" id="calibre_link-1790"></span>
 the seasonal fairs, French and foreign alike, by means of summary procedures and holding the right to enforce its rulings across the kingdom.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-762" href="#calibre_link-1580" class="calibre6">79</a>
</sup>
 Over time, the tribunal sought to broaden its authority to adjudicate all commercial lawsuits, whether or not they arose during the fairs and whether or not they involved merchants. With an edict of July 1669, the monarchy tilted the balance in favor of the <em class="calibre4">Conservation</em>
 by granting it jurisdiction over all disputes regarding commerce and finance (“le fait du négoce et commerce de marchandises”), including bankruptcies, that occurred at any time of the year. The transition to a subject-matter jurisdiction, defined by the nature of the controversies rather than the status of the plaintiffs or the defendants, seemed complete. The edict’s formulation, however, was typically imprecise. One article established that the <em class="calibre4">Conservation</em>
 was to adjudicate cases involving those who traded in commodities, kept their account books, and stipulated payments during the fairs.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-763" href="#calibre_link-1581" class="calibre6">80</a>
</sup>
 Did this capacious category of people extend to nonprofessional merchants, such as noblemen, magistrates or clergymen, who signed bills of exchange and participated in wide networks of commercial credit?</p>
<p class="indent">This question goes to the heart of a central feature of Old Regime France: this society’s ancient disdain toward manual professions and trade was not only deeply rooted in the culture of the time (a theme famously satirized by Molière in his 1670 <em class="calibre4">Bourgeois gentilhomme</em>
 ), but also inscribed in the law. According to the 1563 edict (art. 12) and the 1673 ordinance on commerce (title VII, arts. 1&ndash;2), for example, those unable to repay their bills of exchange were sentenced to prison. Imprisonment for debt (<em class="calibre4">contrainte par corps</em>
 ) was not allowed in regular jurisdictions but was made available to commercial tribunals on the grounds that loans between merchants were not backed by collateral. This norm had severe implications. A titled lord who failed to pay a bill of exchange was now judged by a commercial tribunal and might end up going to prison for debt, sentenced by a court of commoners.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-764" href="#calibre_link-1582" class="calibre6">81</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Such a scenario was so threatening to the established social order that from the sixteenth century onward the titled nobility sought to counter it by hardening existing hierarchies.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-765" href="#calibre_link-1583" class="calibre6">82</a>
</sup>
 Most cities of the kingdom experienced an aristocratization of their political life, with commercial elites sidelined in favor of the nobility and royal officials. In Bordeaux, the municipal council of aldermen saw its influence progressively weakened during the last quarter of the seventeenth century, and Colbert abolished the fiscal privileges associated with the status of <em class="calibre4">bourgeois</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-766" href="#calibre_link-1584" class="calibre6">83</a>
</sup>
 The “nobility of the robe,” a rank that could be acquired via the purchase of certain offices, gained ground over the merchant class.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="89" id="calibre_link-1833"></span>
 The rise of moneyed elites and the legal profession during the sixteenth century also reinvigorated debates over the so-called <em class="calibre4">loi de dérogeance</em>
 , which deprived those aristocrats who engaged in mechanical arts, commercial activities, and public administration of their privileges, including their coveted fiscal immunities. In 1610, the noted jurist Loyseau listed the occupations that caused the forfeiture of noble titles: “prosecuting attorney, clerk of a court, notary, serjeant, clerk in general, merchant, and artisan of any trade, except hunting.” The reason was simple: all these occupations, he explained, are done “for profit.” He added: “It is <em class="calibre4">base and sordid gain</em>
 that derogates from nobility. The proper course for nobility is to live on one’s rents, or at least not to sell one’s efforts and one’s labor.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-767" href="#calibre_link-1585" class="calibre6">84</a>
</sup>
 Profit derived from commerce and banking was considered particularly “base and sordid,” and Loyseau placed merchants one step below judges and lawyers in the hierarchy of non-noblemen.</p>
<p class="indent">This forceful defense of <em class="calibre4">dérogeance</em>
 was a conservative, even reactionary, stance, one that certain circles at court wished to combat because it tied the fortunes of the aristocracy to the land and curbed the state’s ability to bolster French power in the race for overseas expansion and conquest. Richelieu emphasized the dignity of commerce in several initiatives designed to promote France’s ability to compete economically with its rival and foe, the United Provinces. He encouraged the nobility especially to invest in newly chartered (if still fragile) trading companies, such as the <em class="calibre4">Compagnie de la Nouvelle France</em>
 (1627&ndash;1663), which he hoped would expand France’s colonial and commercial presence in North America.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1629, two years after the shipwreck in the Bay of Biscay, the crown urged the Parisian and provincial <em class="calibre4">parlements</em>
 to ratify a comprehensive reform project, known as the Code Michau, that had been in the making for more than a decade. While it reaffirmed the principle of <em class="calibre4">dérogeance</em>
 for all noblemen (art. 198), the Code Michau included an important exception for those who invested in overseas wholesale trade (art. 452). It also allowed for the ennoblement of those merchants who manned a vessel weighing no less than 200 tons for at least five years, as well as anyone who served as a consul or magistrate, as long as he did not engage in petty trade (art. 452). Most of these recommendations, however, remained dead letters, because several provincial <em class="calibre4">parlements</em>
 refused to ratify the Code Michau in its entirety.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-768" href="#calibre_link-1586" class="calibre6">85</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">It took until 1669 for Colbert to succeed where Richelieu had not. A month after issuing the July edict that expanded the <em class="calibre4">Conservation</em>
 ’s jurisdiction in Lyon, the crown crafted a wide-ranging legitimation of commerce, which it described as an essential source of public and private wealth and “one of the <span title="90" id="calibre_link-1835"></span>
 most honest occupations of civil life.” The August 1669 edict further declared that overseas (though not overland) commerce was compatible with the status of nobility and suspended the <em class="calibre4">loi de dérogeance</em>
 whenever a nobleman engaged in maritime trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-769" href="#calibre_link-1587" class="calibre6">86</a>
</sup>
 Those aristocrats who wished to conduct wholesale maritime trade now had to list their names on a public board provided by the merchant tribunal in their town. Four years later, the 1673 <em class="calibre4">ordonnance de commerce</em>
 made everyone who signed a bill of exchange subject to the jurisdiction of merchant-run tribunals (title XII, art. 2). Commenting on this norm 100 years later, a jurist put it bluntly: by signing a bill of exchange, “even noblemen, office-holders, and clergymen” lost their “quality.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-770" href="#calibre_link-1588" class="calibre6">87</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">He was hardly the only one to stress the extent to which the creation of a <em class="calibre4">noblesse commerçante</em>
 and the emergence of subject matter, rather than personal status, as the determinant of jurisdictional prerogatives in commercial disputes were altering time-honored hierarchies. As a lawyer in the Paris <em class="calibre4">parlement</em>
 wrote in 1710, rank had ceased to be a person’s exhaustive and stable descriptor. Someone who held the title of <em class="calibre4">bourgeois</em>
 of Paris but was neither an artisan nor a merchant, he noted, would still be considered a merchant if he bought and sold merchandise for profit. Royal officials, jurists, and clergymen tacitly renounced some of their privileges if they engaged in trade. Even agricultural workers were equated with merchants if they bought tools and goods for their occupation and sold the fruit of their labor. Anyone could call himself a banker: there was no guild to confer that title.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-771" href="#calibre_link-1589" class="calibre6">88</a>
</sup>
 By 1740, a comprehensive treatise on commercial jurisprudence posited that “anyone who mingles in wholesale trade, traffic, artisanal activity, in any merchandise or manufacture is considered a merchant or an artisan, even if he is not an apprentice, has not passed a master test or is in a profession different from that of commerce.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-772" href="#calibre_link-1590" class="calibre6">89</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Predictably, the resistance to these changes was considerable.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-773" href="#calibre_link-1591" class="calibre6">90</a>
</sup>
 In 1722, those Bordeaux merchants who had recently acquired a noble title asked to march ahead of regular merchants in public processions. The central authorities, however, rejected their claims, presumably in an effort to protect the <em class="calibre4">négociants</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-774" href="#calibre_link-1592" class="calibre6">91</a>

 The same incident also exposes the persistence of anticommercial prejudice. Contributors to Diderot’s <em class="calibre4">Encyclopédie</em>
 a few decades later still felt the need to affirm that “the merchant profession is honorable.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-775" href="#calibre_link-1593" class="calibre6">92</a>
</sup>
 Words matter, and yet they cannot engineer cultural change alone. The violent response to a pamphlet published in 1756 by the Jesuit Gabriel-François Coyer that exhorted aristocrats to abandon ancient preconceptions and engage in wholesale trade was the aftershock of an earthquake set in motion a century earlier by Colbert’s reforms.<sup class="calibre7">

Several decades before the crown sanctioned the honorability of those activities that came under the purview of maritime law, Cleirac was already broaching this delicate subject. More than adhering to the strain of “commercial humanism” that Henry Clark has located in early-seventeenth-century France, his commentaries reveal the interdependence of the legal and cultural foundations of the process of conferring dignity on commerce.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-777" href="#calibre_link-1595" class="calibre6">94</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">To justify the importance of his own writing, the Bordeaux lawyer praises the value of all knowledge associated with the art of navigation, notably mathematics and cosmography, which he refers to as “noble sciences.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-778" href="#calibre_link-1596" class="calibre6">95</a>
</sup>
 He even bemoans the tendency among talented young men to pursue the medical profession after graduating from humanist schools and universities and reproaches those who aspire to live as <em class="calibre4">rentiers</em>
 . To counter these propensities and channel French youth toward commerce and marine service, he advocates free public education in the art of navigation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-779" href="#calibre_link-1597" class="calibre6">96</a>
</sup>
 Competence went hand in hand with respectability. While the Portuguese and Dutch appeared to Cleirac to be fluent in all matters pertaining to overseas trade, the inhabitants of the French Atlantic coast were in his estimation more similar to the Swedes and Germans whom he met when employed at the admiralty of Bordeaux: they drank and smoked excessively and lacked knowledge of navigational instruments.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-780" href="#calibre_link-1598" class="calibre6">97</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Here and elsewhere Cleirac echoes a growing literature on the developing middle classes. In a timely, encyclopedic, and moralizing book in Italian vernacular first published in 1585, Tommaso Garzoni catalogued the virtues and vices of 400 “professions,” most of which demanded manual labor. The sheer scope of the project was a tribute to the industriousness of these groups, while the author’s repeated warnings against the corruption into which laborers could sink reflected the genre’s conventions. His treatment of merchants popularized a three-tier classification of this group, with wholesale traders at the top, retail traders (<em class="calibre4">piccoli merciari</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">fondaghieri</em>
 ) in the middle, and “bankers” at the bottom, indistinguishable from “usurers.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-781" href="#calibre_link-1599" class="calibre6">98</a>
</sup>
 Overall, Garzoni’s compilation was filled with both admiration and disdain for merchants: they were described as literate and knowledgeable (well versed in a wide range of goods, weights, measures, and currencies) but also as quick to manipulate the market to their advantage, sell counterfeits, and trick regular folks with incomprehensible commercial papers, causing their ruin. Bankers, in his view, were even worse, with no redeeming qualities.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="92" id="calibre_link-1721"></span>
 Cleirac takes for granted the tripartite scheme that Garzoni propagated. He places “mercers” below wholesale merchants, whom he calls “honorable,” but above “those who trade in money alone, that is, usurers.” In fact, he doubts that usurers&mdash;that is, bankers&mdash;are merchants at all (“ceux-là ne sont pas veritablement marchands”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-782" href="#calibre_link-1600" class="calibre6">99</a>
</sup>
 In the real world, the boundaries between wholesale merchants and bankers were blurred, since no long-distance trade was possible without the use of financial instruments, and few if any international bankers specialized exclusively in finance. The fact that bills of exchange could now be traded as if they were commodities made such rigid classifications meaningless.</p>
<p class="indent">Adopting a Thomistic trope, Cleirac also applauds “the flourishing of commercial exchanges, that is, the reciprocal, fraternal, and fertile communication between all Nations.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-783" href="#calibre_link-1601" class="calibre6">100</a>
</sup>
 In the mid-seventeenth century, to say as much did not imply an endorsement of free trade as a means to promote world peace and tame religious wars, nor did it constitute a programmatic <em class="calibre4">politique</em>
 position that quietly criticized bellicose Catholicism.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-784" href="#calibre_link-1602" class="calibre6">101</a>
</sup>
 In search of social affirmation and political redemption after the Fronde, Cleirac takes a far more conventional and practical stance. In his writings he commends the “good and noble qualities” of those “who furnish bills of exchange when they are needed and make sure they are delivered and paid with probity.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-785" href="#calibre_link-1603" class="calibre6">102</a>
</sup>
 But he draws a line at those bankers whose “gluttony” (<em class="calibre4">ingordigia</em>
 ), as the Florentine Davanzati had called it, led them to transform bills of exchange from means of remitting payments into purely speculative instruments.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-786" href="#calibre_link-1604" class="calibre6">103</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">To lawyers, solicitors, and savants like Cleirac, the venality of offices brought no benefits, since those offices could neither be held in perpetuity nor bequeathed to heirs. Excluded from the nobility of the robe, these professionals were also less threatened by the valorization of commerce. Written before Colbert expanded the purview of commercial and maritime law, and quirky as it is, <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 suggests that the everyday experience of individuals was as important as top-down reforms in paving the way for the normative adoption of more positive attitudes toward commerce. For a trained legal professional, the intellectual project of conferring respectability on commerce and navigation was inseparable from the effort to establish the legal rules that would undergird the performance of those activities. Yet this effort was littered with obstacles. Far from being homogenous and self-enforcing, as some legal theorists and social scientists want them to be, maritime laws remained uneven and contested, both within and beyond the borders of the kingdom.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-787" href="#calibre_link-1605" class="calibre6">104</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="93" id="calibre_link-1792"></span>
 At the same time that Cleirac advocates greater regulation of overseas trade, he implicitly acknowledges the limitations of the written word of the law in taming the dangers of commercial credit. Legal norms, he implies over and over, are a necessary but insufficient tool to curb merchants’ trickery. He expresses pride in France’s welcoming attitude toward foreign merchants but also worries about their undue influence, which he assumes to be at the root of the increase in commercial fraud.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-788" href="#calibre_link-1606" class="calibre6">105</a>
</sup>
 Foreigners, he claims, would impoverish France and its native subjects with “their malicious schemes, swindles, plots, monopolies, cabals, and Jewish ways of dealing (<em class="calibre4">Iuifveries</em>
 ).”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-789" href="#calibre_link-1607" class="calibre6">106</a>
</sup>
 His estimate that these “worm-like activities” of foreign merchants had fleeced 300 or 400 million livres from the province of Guyenne is so exaggerated that it surpasses what scholars assess to be the value of all precious metals that arrived in France from the Americas in 1715.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-790" href="#calibre_link-1608" class="calibre6">107</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The other villains in Cleirac’s story are the financiers and tax farmers of the French monarchy, said to operate as a “secret and sacred cabal” that sought to manipulate the trade in bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-791" href="#calibre_link-1609" class="calibre6">108</a>
</sup>
 Everybody despised tax farmers. In 1637, even the levy of the <em class="calibre4">taille</em>
 , the most widespread direct land tax in the kingdom, was farmed out. Acerbic criticisms of these financiers dotted various genres, from moralizing plays to libels (<em class="calibre4">mazarinades</em>
 ), in which they are depicted as archetypes of greed.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-792" href="#calibre_link-1610" class="calibre6">109</a>
</sup>
 Falling back on his old habit, Cleirac chooses a term with an unmistakable Jewish association, <em class="calibre4">cabale</em>
 , to describe these individuals’ dealings&mdash;a word that other texts of the period used to designate conspiratorial associations of merchants who manipulated prices or defrauded consumers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-793" href="#calibre_link-934" class="calibre6">110</a>
</sup>
 Backing up his arguments with the usual eclectic mix of citations, Cleirac denounces state financiers for their propensity to “turn public poverty into private wealth.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-794" href="#calibre_link-1611" class="calibre6">111</a>
</sup>
 This portrait evinces no confidence in the ability of economic actors to self-regulate but also displays limited faith in the power of public authorities to defend themselves (and their subjects) from cunning speculators.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, Cleirac oscillates between faith in the “medicine” that regulation provides (in his account, the Hanseatic League is the best “doctor” for healing the diseases of commerce) and a more general sense of despair in the face of the various subterfuges that invariably strip good laws of their efficacy. He recalls the creation in 1576 of a new guild of brokers (<em class="calibre4">corratiers</em>
 ) to oversee all transactions negotiated by foreigners, whether in cash or by credit.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-795" href="#calibre_link-1612" class="calibre6">112</a>
</sup>
 These brokers were made collectively liable for all payments in the hope that this obligation would lead them to scrutinize the affairs of their clients while simultaneously protecting those guild members who took on ill-fated business <span title="94" id="calibre_link-1793"></span>
 unintentionally. As Cleirac reports, abuses soon abounded: some foreigners, for example, joined the brokers’ guild and colluded with merchants abroad. With characteristic pessimism about merchants’ dispositions, he concludes that everyone put his personal gain above that of the collective and blames the guild’s board for lacking the will and the ability to contain fraud.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-796" href="#calibre_link-1613" class="calibre6">113</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">If neither self-interest nor legal enforcement kept merchants in line, what could? Cleirac never supplies a straightforward answer. The legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange and marine insurance filled this void in a symbolically prescriptive way that was more intelligible then than now. Cleirac’s verbal attacks against “foreigners” and tax farmers are less virulent than those against Jews, but they respond to the same logic. In both cases, he defines proper commercial conduct by pointing to its opposite. And yet, to repeat, he was no enemy of the embryonic French commercial society. He refuses to degrade merchants as a whole, arguing: “The lowly birth of a craft . . . or the mischievousness of those who abuse it do not diminish the integrity, do not pollute the candor, do not darken the glaring reputation of upright workers.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-797" href="#calibre_link-1614" class="calibre6">114</a>
</sup>
 He declares his respect for “honorable bankers, those who practice their financial businesses (<em class="calibre4">négoce pecuniaire</em>
 ) with loyalty and in good faith like respectable people (<em class="calibre4">gens de bien</em>
 ).”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-798" href="#calibre_link-1615" class="calibre6">115</a>

 But he warns too that “credit insinuates itself in commerce only to introduce bankruptcy and the fire of chicanery.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-799" href="#calibre_link-1616" class="calibre6">116</a>

 His didactic impulse always brings him back to the same point: honorable merchants are the opposite of “Jews, Lombards, Cahorsins, and those who go bankrupt.”<sup class="calibre7">

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2061">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">The decree of March 31, 1492, that expelled Jews from the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, and Granada granted them a window of four months during which they were allowed to sell their property. They were forbidden from taking gold, silver, minted coins, and outlawed merchandise out of the country but permitted to export the proceedings of their sales either in kind or through bills of exchange (<em class="calibre4">canbios</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-801" href="#calibre_link-1618" class="calibre6">118</a>

 Indeed, some Spanish Jews succeeded in carrying liquid assets (the value of which was arguably much diminished by the forced sales) to safety by buying bills of exchange from Genoese merchants, who made those bills payable to them abroad.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">We have no way of knowing whether the memory of these events may have stimulated the imagination of those who witnessed the arrival of Iberian refugees <span title="95" id="calibre_link-1775"></span>
 in Bordeaux before and after 1550. But at the end of a reasonably exhaustive search, we can conclude that no formulation of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange and marine insurance appeared in print prior to <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 . Why, then, did Bordeaux in the mid-seventeenth century prove to be a fertile ground for the fantasy that placed Jews at the center of the development of modern credit instruments in Europe? We cannot pinpoint a precise incident or encounter that might have triggered the creation of this legend&mdash;not even Cleirac’s participation in the disputes over property rights concerning the surviving cargo of the <em class="calibre4">São Bartolomeu</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">Santa Helena</em>
 . But whether Cleirac coined or merely repeated it, the legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange was his attempt at making sense of the changes in the legal, political, and social orders that the expansion of overseas commerce set in motion.</p>
<p class="indent">Cleirac’s life unfolded in a city where Jews were indistinguishable from local and foreign Christian merchants involved in long-distance trade, many of whom no longer belonged to a guild. It would not have surprised anyone in seventeenth-century France that New Christians, Catholics, and Protestants signed each others’ bills of exchange and underwrote each others’ marine insurance policies. The private records of a prominent Tuscan banking family, the Salviati, show that its Lyon branch assisted the legendary Beatriz Mendes, also known as Doña Gracia Nasi (c.1510&ndash;1569), by transacting bills of exchange on her behalf under various pseudonyms so that she could transfer funds to her family members across Europe and to fellow baptized Jews in Portugal as she fled the Inquisition.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-803" href="#calibre_link-1620" class="calibre6">120</a>
</sup>
 Unfortunately, no collection of private business papers from Bordeaux survives from the first half of the seventeenth century, even if there is evidence that New Christians were embedded in confessionally and religiously diverse commercial networks.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-804" href="#calibre_link-1621" class="calibre6">121</a>
</sup>
 Merchants’ letters dating from 100 years later show that both those “Portuguese” who remained ostensibly Catholic and those who began to practice Judaism in the open traded in bills of exchange with merchants, officials, and clergymen of all religions and confessions.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-805" href="#calibre_link-1622" class="calibre6">122</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Until 1723, however, crypto-Judaism was an institutionalized reality in Bordeaux. The consequence of this state of affairs was an escalation of the crisis of legibility in the boundaries separating Jews and Christians that had begun after the mass conversions of Spanish Jews during the 1390s and the forced baptisms administered across Iberia a century later. The specter of crypto-Judaism infuses Cleirac’s narrative of the origins of marine insurance <span title="96" id="calibre_link-1689"></span>
 and bills of exchange. In this tale, he demonizes an imagined medieval world in which Jews supposedly outmaneuvered Christian kings, traders, and poor folks with their financial savvy but also longs for those times when one could tell a Jew from a Christian, when visible exterior markers set roguish money-lenders apart from respectable merchants. In reality, visible markers had never been sufficient standards of respectability. But appearances admittedly became more fluid in the early modern period. Compared to medieval Jewish pawn-brokers, the “Portuguese merchants” of Bordeaux and the Sephardim who were involved in the Atlantic economy of the seventeenth century lived by all measures a less segregated life.</p>
<p class="indent">Questions about who was a Christian and who was a Jew were not entirely separate from better-known debates about what criteria made a person noble, debates that often considered the types of economic activities that were and were not compatible with an aristocratic status. In a fictional dialogue written in Florence around 1440, the humanist Poggio Bracciolini pitted nobility of virtue against nobility of birth. Defending the latter, one of his characters objected that if “paintings, sculptures, elegance, wealth, and ample possessions, as well as public offices and positions of authorities” might confer noble status, then “even moneylenders, no matter how wicked and abominable, would be noble just by being rich and holding public office.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-806" href="#calibre_link-1623" class="calibre6">123</a>
</sup>
 Nowhere in early modern Europe, not even in eminently mercantile societies like Holland and England, did individual merit and the pursuit of profit fully displace older notions of heritable honor. But wherever feudalism had deeper roots, as in France, resistance to the conferral of respectability onto merchants was stronger. An ancient morality still suffused this battle between mercantile and aristocratic cultures, a worldview based on Aristotle’s argument that condemned the traffic in money but conceded the utility of international trade between regions with different natural endowments and industries, as well as on the Stoic distinction between wholesale trade (which was regarded as acceptable) and retail trade (which was deemed degrading).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-807" href="#calibre_link-1624" class="calibre6">124</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">More than a century before the 1789 Revolution, the French crown purposefully inserted a fissure in the feudal structure by creating incentives for aristocrats to invest in overseas trade without being stigmatized for doing so. Implementation of such initiatives was slow and hampered by opposition, because they hit at the heart of long-established legal and cultural hierarchies. Coupled with Colbert’s reforms of the jurisdictional reach of commercial tribunals, these measures broadened significantly the definition of who was a merchant. After 1673, the public performance of a contract altered an individual’s <span title="97" id="calibre_link-1747"></span>
 relation to the state and society, even if it did not altogether override the formal assignment of a rank (whether that assignment had been made at birth or through a formal change of status, such as that associated with the nobility of the robe).</p>
<p class="indent">Scholarship critical of progressive theories of European state-building has long emphasized the insufficiency of rank as an operative category of historical analysis on the grounds that Old Regime institutions were too weak to enforce all the norms they produced and that social action altered the meanings of the formal hierarchies designed by the state. Simona Cerutti makes a compelling case for the role that social recognition played in the definition of a claimant’s legal status. She shows that in eighteenth-century Turin, the medieval notion of a “foreigner” as someone who had weak social ties to local society and was therefore potentially suspicious continued to inform how judges deliberated and how plaintiffs approached the court.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-808" href="#calibre_link-1625" class="calibre6">125</a>
</sup>
 Such work has the merit of bridging legal and social history to produce a less anachronistic understanding of actors’ sense of belonging in urban communities in the highly stratified societies of Old Regime Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">If we consider the terms under which Jews were allowed to reside in different European cities after the sixteenth century, this perspective raises additional questions that matter to both Jewish and European history. From a strict legal perspective, Jews were not always the paradigmatic foreigners. In Livorno, for example, Sephardic merchants were subjects of the grand duchy. Elsewhere, they possessed the same contractual rights as other merchants. Yet on a symbolic level, they never shed their own cultural foreignness entirely. Cleirac’s commentaries on maritime law illuminate some little-known aspects of the cultural process that accompanied the redefinition of legal and social hierarchies during the last two centuries of the Old Regime.</p>
<p class="indent">New Christians in Bordeaux lived as naturalized subjects of the crown and planted deep roots but, as a collective, were never trusted. The peculiar regime of toleration that the monarchy adopted in southwestern France sought to conceal the presence of Jews and at the same time intensified public fears of a Jewish presence. Meanwhile, the expansion of commercial society in seventeenth-century France meant that the institutions that once defined its membership, imperfect as they were, were being chipped away, and traditional markers of status were receding in the marketplace. It was in this environment that the legend of the Jewish origins of marine insurance and bills of exchange emerged.</p>
<p class="indent">A host of fanciful but evocative analogies arguably fostered the association between Jews and immaterial credit instruments. Like baptized Jews who fled <span title="98" id="calibre_link-1748"></span>
 the Inquisition, bills of exchange moved across geopolitical borders with great ease. Bills of exchange, like Jews, operated on the basis of a secret language unintelligible to outsiders. Like New Christians who passed themselves off as devout Catholics, fraudulent use of bills of exchange was not easily detectable.</p>
<p class="indent">Baffling as these analogies may appear today, they help us make sense of how contemporaries approached the key problem raised by the contractual equality and self-regulation of commercial society, namely, how to detect a dishonest merchant when he operated outside a corporate regime of verification. Modern readers may be disoriented by Cleirac’s approach to this problem because standard accounts have expunged Jewish metaphors from the history of European economic thought of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and concentrated instead on other intellectual and institutional ways of grappling with the same issue. In the last quarter of the seventeenth century, Colbert believed the solution to the problem of merchants’ greed consisted of stronger state regulatory structures and a capillary system of inspection (<a href="#calibre_link-298" class="calibre6">chapter 5</a>
 ). A century after Cleirac, Montesquieu’s concept of <em class="calibre4">doux commerce</em>
 allowed for greater optimism about the natural tendency of commerce to “soften” merchants’ bad proclivities and turned attention instead to the dilemma of how to contain rapacious rulers (<a href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre6">chapter 6</a>
 ). Later in the eighteenth century, Adam Smith denounced monopolies and offered a full-blown formulation of the benefits of free trade based on the notion that the prospect of future gains would keep traders from misbehaving. Many have tendentiously interpreted Smith’s thesis to be the definitive answer to the problem of self-interest and corruption. In the next chapters, we will see that salient features of these better-known paradigms ought to be revisited in light of their treatment of a legend that we have forgotten but that early modern authors knew well.</p>

<span class="small1">JACQUE SAVARY’S</span>
 <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 , first printed in 1675, was the manifesto of seventeenth-century French commercial society. It was also the most reprinted, translated, and plagiarized merchant manual of early modern Europe. A far more experienced and effective writer than Cleirac, Savary shared with his predecessor a commitment to setting new legal and cultural standards for private trade and finance. With a deft editorial hand, he repeated the fictional account of Jews’ invention of bills of exchange while also streamlining and purging the seven relevant pages of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 of their overt anti-Jewish language. In so doing, Savary singlehandedly ensured the legend’s propagation. In its abbreviated and sanitized form, the tale was picked up by several other authors. After Savary’s death, two of his sons published a massive dictionary of commerce, the first of its genre, which proved to be another bestseller of the <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 and disseminated the legend even further. Taken together, the complete works of the Savarys, father and sons, constitute the most articulate explication of the norms and ethos that infused the practice and politics of commerce under the reigns of Louis XIV (r. 1643&ndash;1715) and Louis XV (r. 1715&ndash;1744).</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="100" id="calibre_link-1836"></span>
 Several reasons account for the fortune of these publications. They contained an unprecedented amount of practical information and summarized government regulations on trade, although the extent to which merchants availed themselves of printed instructions when making strategic decisions about their businesses remains unclear.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-810" href="#calibre_link-90" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
 Above all, the Savary family stepped in at the right moment and gave the new figure of the wholesale merchant the respectability it needed. Louis XIV’s trusted minister of finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, sought to reinvigorate trade and manufacturing by reforming the legal, fiscal, and administrative apparatus of the French economy. In 1669, as we saw, he allowed, and in fact encouraged, noblemen to engage in long-distance trade and subjected them to the same legal framework that governed commoners involved in maritime commerce. It is difficult to overestimate the significance of these reforms in a society dominated by the notion of rank and in which rank was inseparable from the administration of justice. But it is equally important to realize that these reforms would have been moot without an accompanying reorganization of societal values.</p>
<p class="indent">
<em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 did more than any other publication to address the cultural shift that Colbert’s legal innovations implied and demanded. The book’s title captured the essence and magnitude of this shift. It dispensed with the generic term <em class="calibre4">marchand</em>
 , which denoted both wholesale and retail traders, as well as some artisans, and echoed a corporate terminology of ancient pedigree (the original six guilds of Paris were called <em class="calibre4">corps des marchands</em>
 , and their head was the <em class="calibre4">prévot des marchands</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-811" href="#calibre_link-91" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
 Savary chose instead the word <em class="calibre4">négociant</em>
 , which beginning in the seventeenth century referred exclusively to a merchant involved in wholesale and overseas trade who was versed in the financial transactions that exchanges over long distances required. Moreover, a <em class="calibre4">négociant</em>
 was not necessarily a guild member but rather someone known publicly as a merchant&mdash;a connotation that broadened the range of those who might be qualified as such.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-812" href="#calibre_link-92" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The Scholastic economic theory in which Cleirac was schooled conceived of guilds as repositories of the knowledge necessary to ensure the fairness of market exchanges. When moral theologians spoke of the “general estimation” (<em class="calibre4">communis aestimatio</em>
 ) that ought to determine what prices were just and thus acceptable, they assumed the existence of a specialized professional group, whose boundaries were traditionally defined by guild membership, that had the ability to evaluate the process of price formation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-813" href="#calibre_link-93" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
 By testing apprentices’ skills, inspecting raw materials, and vouching for the quality of the goods put on sale, guilds were supposed to protect consumers while also shielding workers <span title="101" id="calibre_link-1837"></span>
 and merchants from unfair competition. In reality, more often than not, guilds turned into corrupt cartels. Yet the alternative&mdash;open and free competition&mdash;was not a universal remedy either, not so much because it did not belong to the ideological landscape of the time as because it was (and is) equally imperfect: there is no market in which everyone possesses the same information or wields identical influence. The erosion of the corporate structure that governed those merchants who were involved in long-distance trade and private finance during the sixteenth century and the emergence of the <em class="calibre4">négociant</em>
 as a key figure left authorities and the public alike in need of a new institutional framework to oversee and regulate trade and its practitioners.</p>
<p class="indent">How were young men to learn the rules of the game when guild apprenticeship was no longer mandatory and only minimal public instruction was offered? How were established merchants to monitor each other’s behavior as more and more actors flooded the marketplace? Now that foreign merchants paced the Bourse of Bordeaux and noblemen could invest in the Atlantic trade, a freer and more mobile commercial society promised to unleash new talent and resources (at least for the privileged few capable of availing themselves of these opportunities). But this fluidity also harbored new dangers. How was it possible to keep those dangers in check without curtailing entrepreneurship? How could traders who did not belong to a guild ensure that everyone operated intelligently and honestly?</p>
<p class="indent">Colbert regarded commerce and manufacturing as sources of national power but was exceedingly fearful of merchants’ autonomy. He did not believe that entrepreneurs had the desire or ability to curb their most extravagant ambitions. He therefore promoted as a counterbalance parallel organizations, including royal manufacturing establishments and state-funded commercial companies, and appointed royal inspectors to monitor the manufacturing, commercial, and fiscal sectors.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-814" href="#calibre_link-94" class="calibre6">6</a>
</sup>
 These regulatory initiatives, however, ran the risk of stifling entrepreneurship and creating new forms of dependency on the central government. Works like Savary’s were designed to lend respectability to <em class="calibre4">négociants</em>
 and to strike a balance between autonomy and regulation through the definition of informal yardsticks against which merchants could measure their behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">As royal decrees injected elements of contract into a society of status, new written and unwritten norms were needed to police the marketplace. In this unsettling transitional moment, authors like Cleirac and Savary appealed to the figure of the Jewish merchant to convey universal standards of how <em class="calibre4">not</em>
 to handle commercial and financial transactions. The thirteenth-century <span title="102" id="calibre_link-1692"></span>
 association between Jews and usury was so profoundly imprinted on Christian minds that it remained meaningful even as Jews became connected with commercial credit rather than pawnbroking. With Marseilles and the Mediterranean at the epicenter of Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Parfait négociant</em>
 , the fears about the hidden influence of New Christians that had haunted Cleirac in Bordeaux gave way to a different, though not incompatible trope: that of the all-powerful Jewish trader who outmaneuvered rivals by virtue of his supposedly domineering position in the exchanges between Christian Europe and the Muslim Mediterranean. A proto-Orientalist discourse added a new dimension to this trope. In travel accounts and commercial literature, different segments of the Jewish diaspora were lumped together with other ethno-religious minorities. Jews came to be mentioned frequently alongside Armenians and, by the eighteenth century, Greeks. Christian observers praised all of these groups as the opposite of the allegedly indolent and unskilled Muslims and yet demonized the subterfuges that they all supposedly used to trick French merchants.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-815" href="#calibre_link-95" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The new trope of the omnipotent Mediterranean Jewish trader infused the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange and marine insurance with new meaning. In this chapter and the next, I chart the legend’s reception in France from the mid-seventeenth century to the Revolution. I identify four phases in its propagation, separated by two moments of discontinuity (the list of French titles that mention this legend is found in appendix 5). The “consecration” phase (1647&ndash;1690) was interrupted by the earliest refutation of the legend’s validity in 1690. While the rebuff was not universal, skepticism toward Cleirac’s narrative emerged and nurtured alternative origin stories, including one connecting the invention of bills of exchange to Florentine expatriates in Lyon. The “dissemination” phase (1700&ndash;1748) culminated in a second break, this time brought about by Montesquieu’s novel interpretation of the legend in 1748, and its consequences were more profound. I then divide the second half of the eighteenth century into a “bifurcation” phase (1748&ndash;1775), during which Montesquieu’s more positive version of the legend coexisted alongside the earlier and darker one proposed by Cleirac and Savary, and a final phase (1775&ndash;1791), during which this darker version entered the prerevolutionary debates about Jewish emancipation.</p>
<p class="indent">In recounting the legend’s permutations, I stress both the persistence and the malleability of Christian images of Jewish economic roles. I also assess the role that context and intertextuality played in the reproduction and elaboration of certain tropes and not others. Ultimately, my analysis aims to broaden <span title="103" id="calibre_link-1698"></span>
 the current map of French economic thought and puts pressure on accepted historical accounts of the relationship between economic, social, and&mdash;by the late eighteenth century&mdash;political order that regard commerce as a progressive force.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2062">Phase I (1647&ndash;1690): Consecration</h3>
<p class="noindent">If the gist of the convoluted pages of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 endured the passing of time and left a mark on the European imagination, it is first and foremost thanks to Jacques Savary (1622&ndash;1690), the bestselling author of the early modern European <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 and the mastermind behind the 1673 <em class="calibre4">ordonnance de commerce</em>
 , the first European national code of commercial law. Shortly after its publication, <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 was translated into German (1676) and Dutch (1683). By 1800 it had appeared in at least twenty-nine French editions, some of which considerably expanded on the first one.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-816" href="#calibre_link-96" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">More extensive and accurate than any of its antecedents, Savary’s manual walked a merchant through every bit of information he needed to succeed, from weights and measurements to partnership contracts, bookkeeping, and more. It borrowed from previous Italian examples, such as Peri’s <em class="calibre4">Il negotiante</em>
 , from its author’s personal experience, and from a wealth of legal documents. The 1679 edition, which would become the canonical one, also reproduced many reports (<em class="calibre4">mémoires</em>
 ) written by merchants, travelers, and government officials, often anonymously and usually at the request of state agencies, which constituted a distinctive genre documenting commerce and its policing in Old Regime France. No doubt Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes</em>
 lay on Savary’s desk, even if it went unmentioned in the latter’s work; after all, period standards for citations and plagiarism did not demand bibliographical references.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-817" href="#calibre_link-97" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Bills of exchange were an obligatory topic of any merchant manual, and Savary introduced the subject with a chapter on their “origin and usefulness for commerce.” There he offered a condensed version of the legend. He omitted any mention of marine insurance, a subject that his book did not treat. He also eliminated all vituperative invective regarding Jews and usury, but by affirming the Jewish origin of bills of exchange, Savary cast a shadow over the morality of those credit instruments. The setting of this pseudo-history in France and its apparent richness of factual details elevated the tone of the tale. In place of Cleirac’s meandering narrative, he presented a synthetic and ostensibly linear chronicle of events. Cleirac had indicated the names of the three kings responsible for the medieval expulsions that supposedly led Jews to <span title="104" id="calibre_link-1783"></span>
 invent bills of exchange. Savary added the dates of each expulsion ordered by those kings: Dagobert I in 640, Philip Augustus in 1182, and Philip the Tall in 1316.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-818" href="#calibre_link-98" class="calibre6">10</a>
</sup>
 These dates arguably boosted the legend’s credentials; not surprisingly, multiple authors thereafter repeated them (with occasional additions and modifications).</p>
<p class="indent">Savary followed Cleirac in affirming that “Italian Lombards,” having found “the invention of bills of exchange to be very useful to cover up usury,” took up the habit of using those bills and carried them wherever they went. But Savary also gave the narrative a new and lasting twist: he attributed to the Ghibellines, not to the Jews, the invention of re-exchange, the more sophisticated credit instrument that permitted merchant-bankers to use bills of exchange to engage in currency arbitrage rather than simply use them to pay for goods abroad (<a href="#calibre_link-99" class="calibre6">chapter 1</a>
 ). Though re-exchange was among the new financial instruments that troubled theologians the most, it was also a tribute to the cleverness of international merchants and bankers, who took advantage of the asymmetry of information in currency markets to reap profits&mdash;something ordinary observers found baffling but that Savary eulogized. The twist that Savary added to the story was not entirely novel. Half a century earlier, another French author, Mathias Maréschal, had maintained that Italian rather than French merchants had devised the mechanism of re-exchange. But Maréschal did so because he did not want the French to be tainted by business practices that theologians despised.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-819" href="#calibre_link-100" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
 Savary magnified this seemingly minor detail and put it in a positive light. Instead of condemning re-exchange, he used it to restore Italian merchants to a more important position in the historical arc of European finance.</p>
<p class="indent">Why did Savary endorse the story of the Jewish origin of bills of exchange, at least in their earliest and most rudimentary form, with such conviction? Born four decades after Cleirac, Savary still lived at a time when commerce’s reputation in France was both fragile and contested. His family had lost its noble status in the fifteenth century because of its involvement in trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-820" href="#calibre_link-101" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
 By his mid-thirties, Savary had reached the top tier of the mercer guild in Paris, where he worked as a wholesale merchant (<em class="calibre4">mercier-marchand en gros</em>
 ) and accumulated a considerable fortune.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-821" href="#calibre_link-102" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
 Encouraged by Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s superintendent of finance, he purchased a royal office for the management of custom duties. After the fall of Fouquet, Colbert overlooked his resentment toward his predecessor and, recognizing Savary’s talent, tapped him to chair the commission charged with drafting a comprehensive royal ordinance on commerce.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-822" href="#calibre_link-103" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="105" id="calibre_link-1817"></span>
 Together, this piece of legislation and <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 laid the legal and cultural foundations for a commercial society based on contract rather than rank. But the aristocratic tradition that Savary challenged could not be overturned instantaneously. A far more successful public servant and writer than Cleirac, Savary outlined his goals for <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 very clearly. He wished to provide a pedagogical instrument for those embarking on a career in long-distance trade and to legitimize the merchant profession as “useful” (<em class="calibre4">utile</em>
 ) and “honorable” (<em class="calibre4">honorable</em>
 ). Both words are crucial. Other French authors before him, including Cleirac and Jean Eon, had also seized on the term “honor,” the quintessential aristocratic quality and a supposedly inheritable characteristic, speaking of “honorable merchants” and “honorable commerce.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-823" href="#calibre_link-104" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 Savary specified that a noble pedigree ought not impede a career in commerce and, conversely, praised everyone’s quest for profit and desire to better themselves (“le profit et le desir de s’élever”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-824" href="#calibre_link-105" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
 Although no longer based on birth, hierarchies were still essential. Savary drew a sharp distinction along Ciceronian lines between ordinary traders involved in local retail and brokerage and more elite <em class="calibre4">négociants</em>
 active in transregional exchanges and finance. Advocates of the nobility’s involvement in commerce latched onto this new hierarchy as a way to confer dignity on long-despised activities. A clergyman from Marseilles, François Marchetty, argued that noblemen engaged in long-distance trade (“nobles marchands”) should not be confused with regular merchants (“simples bourgeois &amp; des autres negociants”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-825" href="#calibre_link-106" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The other half of Savary’s formula for legitimating commerce in the age of Colbert was utility, or the alignment of private and public interests. Savary’s entire body of work argued for the interdependence of the monarchy’s mercantilist interests and merchants’ private interests. In this view, a stronger and more respectable merchant class was needed if the monarchy wished to prevail in the increasingly competitive arena of international trade. Savary’s patron, Colbert, however, was wary of private merchants. In a letter of 1679 to the <em class="calibre4">intendant</em>
 in the region of Marseilles, he denounced their selfishness and lack of concern for the welfare of the state: “The Marseillais merchants, who care for nothing but the little profit they can make, and who abuse the liberty that they have been given up to now to ship money as they like to the Levant, do so against . . . the universal and fundamental law of all states, which prohibits the transport of gold and currency on pain of death.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-826" href="#calibre_link-107" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 struck a less pessimistic chord. Like Cleirac, Savary denounced successful merchants’ habit of purchasing offices that conferred a noble title (“charges de la robe”) for their sons. But compared to Cleirac and <span title="106" id="calibre_link-1751"></span>
 Colbert, Savary had a less bleak view of merchants and their ambitions. He even referred to the “sweetness of commerce” (“c’est ce commerce aussi qui fait toute la douceur de la vie”), although the phrase still did not have the larger meaning that Montesquieu later attributed to it.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-827" href="#calibre_link-108" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
 The goal of <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 , Savary reassured his readers and the public authorities, was not to divulge trade secrets learned on the ground but rather to establish the conditions under which individuals would not engage in reckless behavior and easily squander fortunes.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-828" href="#calibre_link-109" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
 Savary remained concerned with the nefarious effects that commerce could unintentionally produce. In his view, only the state could reduce these potentially negative effects, and the state, not private individuals, should remain the primary driver of commercial expansion.</p>
<p class="indent">
<em class="calibre4">Mercantilism</em>
 (which is itself not an early modern term) is how scholars have labeled the political economy promoted by Colbert, which Savary translated into everyday practice for French <em class="calibre4">négociants</em>
 . If we wish to retain that label, we ought to understand it not only as a set of policies molded on a conception of international commerce as a zero-sum game that privileged exports over imports, but also as a belief in the need for a centralized visible hand to orchestrate merchants’ actions. This doctrine placed little faith in merchants’ ability to self-regulate.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-829" href="#calibre_link-110" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Bills of exchange played an important role in theories and practices of mercantilism, broadly defined. By moving large sums in and out of the kingdom, private merchants and the crown’s financiers altered exchange rates between French and foreign currencies and thus affected France’s position in international commerce.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-830" href="#calibre_link-111" class="calibre6">22</a>
</sup>
 At this time, there was no central coordinating institution able to stabilize financial markets in moments of crisis. Savary emphasized both the logic of a self-policing commercial society (merchants would be likely to show prudence in using bills of exchange because they depended on them) and the need for surveillance (by rulers who wanted to prevent improper manipulations and the outflow of capital).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-831" href="#calibre_link-112" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In his chapter on the “origin of bills of exchange and their commercial usefulness,” Savary affirmed, not once but twice, that “there is nothing more useful to the State and to the public than the use of bills of exchange.” To this emphatic endorsement, however, he added a cautionary note: “But it should also be admitted that there is nothing more dangerous than this commerce, which produces a great deal of usury and bankruptcies when bankers, merchants, and traders practice it with lust and imprudence.” What constituted “lust and imprudence” (“convoitise &amp; imprudence”), and how was it possible to inhibit these vices? For Savary, the architect of the 1673 code, re-exchange <span title="107" id="calibre_link-1752"></span>
 contracts in themselves were neither lustful nor imprudent. Better equipped than Cleirac to answer technical questions and less dependent on theologians, he nonetheless shared with his Bordelais predecessor a heightened concern for the hidden ways in which bills of exchange could engender ruinous effects. Elsewhere he noted that dry exchange, condemned by canon law as usurious, was responsible for the greatest number of bankruptcies.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-832" href="#calibre_link-113" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 New decrees and jurisprudence, Savary implied, did not contain sufficiently firm benchmarks for limiting “lust and imprudence.” Written laws inevitably included loopholes and had to be complemented by shared cultural norms to become enforceable.</p>
<p class="indent">In an effort to lay out those cultural norms, Savary oscillated between didactic invocations of Jews as dishonest traders and a matter-of-fact recognition of the degree to which Jewish merchants participated in Europe’s commercial society. This ambivalence came into full view in his <em class="calibre4">Parères</em>
 , a compilation of his legal opinions on seventy lawsuits over matters of commerce. Commenting on an intricate case concerning the fine imposed on a broker for handling a bill of exchange improperly, Savary pointed to Jews as the medieval inventors of classic four-party bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-833" href="#calibre_link-114" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
 Here the legend, mentioned casually, functioned as a placeholder. The linkage cast a shadow on financial practices that, while widespread, could derail honest businesses. The 1673 ordinance prohibited brokers from issuing or cashing bills of exchange in their own names, but not from using their insider knowledge to their customers’ advantage. Brokers, Savary claimed, were responsible for the majority of bankruptcies of merchants and large commercial houses.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-834" href="#calibre_link-115" class="calibre6">26</a>
</sup>
 Since real-life Jews could not be brokers in early modern France, the tale of the Jewish origin of bills of exchange functioned as a warning: some people could take advantage of those bills to the detriment of others in ways that the written law could not regulate. In another legal opinion, however, Savary addressed actual Jews (albeit not Jews from France). His clients, French Catholics, had issued bills for Jewish agents in Antwerp who had failed to follow the proper procedures to protest those bills they did not wish to accept. Savary used no denigrating words in reference to these individuals. At most, he called his clients by name while referring to their Antwerp correspondents as “the Jews.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-835" href="#calibre_link-116" class="calibre6">27</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, Savary exemplifies a tendency that we find across the literature on commerce from the last quarter of the seventeenth century on: Jews and other minorities were sometimes matter-of-factly referred to as a presence in European and global marketplaces and other times were depicted as sinister characters not to be trusted. Jews in particular provided a yardstick against <span title="108" id="calibre_link-1762"></span>
 which all of the evils that lurked behind the growing paper economy could be measured. They could perform this allegorical role because of the assumptions that authors and readers shared. Some of these assumptions that appeared in <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 were the same as those that informed <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 . In spite of his more detached tone, Savary nevertheless described Jews as ominous characters who devised letters “of very few words and little substance,” reiterating the notion that the cryptic language of bills of exchange could trick nonexperts. He also portrayed Jews as going out of their way to squeeze as much profit as possible from foreign transactions: “Because this sort of people is so attuned to opportunities for gain and profit, they make every effort to acquire knowledge about the intrinsic value and possible impurities of all currencies in order to avoid any mistakes in calculating monetary transactions.”</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time as it relied on age-old negative associations between Jews and credit, <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 also incorporated new variants of these motifs, with the figure of the Jewish pawnbroker making way for that of the formidable Jewish international merchant. On the surface these two archetypes might appear to contradict one another: we associate the former with an economy of scarcity and the latter with abundance and commercial credit. In fact, usury linked the two in both the learned tradition and the popular imagination. Literally, <em class="calibre4">usury</em>
 meant the charging of interest, but since to charge interest was to exploit borrowers, <em class="calibre4">usury</em>
 was also used to denote unfair economic practices more generally. The perceived overrepresentation of Jews in certain areas of Mediterranean and colonial trade was easily construed as a case of usury because Jews were seen as an oligopolistic group able to extract unreasonable prices from non-Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-836" href="#calibre_link-117" class="calibre6">28</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Savary made sparing use of the word <em class="calibre4">usury</em>
 , but when he did use it, he evoked its more capacious meaning. Discussing various forms of credit, he advised wholesale merchants not to charge higher interest on late payments, a practice he called “a horrific usury,” because to do so increased the chance that debtors would go bankrupt.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-837" href="#calibre_link-118" class="calibre6">29</a>
</sup>
 The logic was airtight: proper ethics and self-interest would yield the same outcome. In the 1676 Franco-German edition of <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 , he added a few more pieces of advice, urging wholesale merchants not to lend on collateral to avoid the wrath of God and not to charge interest when lending to close friends because to do so would mean to behave like Jews (“car ce seroit imiter les Juifs”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-838" href="#calibre_link-119" class="calibre6">30</a>
</sup>
 Here Jews stood in for the heartless moneylender who put his interest ahead of human sympathy and the common good.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="109" id="calibre_link-1693"></span>
 Elsewhere in Savary’s work, Jewish merchants acquired new sociological features that were part reality and part fantasy. Savary portrayed those operating in northern Europe, and especially in Amsterdam, as rivaling Christian commercial elites, not only in wealth but also in worldly sophistication. Those operating throughout the Mediterranean, however, he depicted as untrust-worthy wheelers and dealers and the keepers of secret information on how to conduct business with Arabs and Turks. In the first edition of <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 , the inclusion of the legend was Savary’s only significant engagement with a Jewish-related theme. But as French experts’ reports on Mediterranean trade were incorporated into the 1679 expanded edition, Jews began to figure more prominently. Those in Livorno were said to monopolize all trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-839" href="#calibre_link-120" class="calibre6">31</a>
</sup>
 In Smyrna and other Ottoman ports, French merchants were described as being at the mercy of Jews and Armenians, from whom they borrowed at exorbitant interest rates.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-840" href="#calibre_link-121" class="calibre6">32</a>
</sup>
 Given the market power of these people, there were great profits to be made by trading with them, Savary told his readers, but one had to be ready to take risks that were even greater than normal circumstances would demand because of “the bad faith that there may be in Jews and Armenians.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-841" href="#calibre_link-122" class="calibre6">33</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This shift in the portrayal of Jews from pawnbrokers to the dominant merchant group in the Mediterranean mixed old clichés with new conditions in Marseilles, Savary’s adoptive town. Unlike Cleirac’s Bordeaux, Marseilles was not home to a New Christian community and became instead a battleground in the dispute between the crown and the local merchant elite over whether to extend commercial privileges to Jews, Armenians, Calvinists, Muslims, and foreigners more generally. In April 1669, Colbert declared Marseilles a free port. His intention was not only to attract merchandise by way of low tariffs but also to lure Jewish and Armenian merchants to the region in an effort to capitalize on their extensive trade networks in the Mediterranean. But he met with staunch opposition from the local merchant oligarchy, organized in the kingdom’s first Chamber of Commerce (created in 1650), which ultimately prevailed. The edict was revised to restrict low customs duties to French merchants and shipowners while imposing significantly higher tariffs on all foreigners and their ships.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-842" href="#calibre_link-123" class="calibre6">34</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Armenians and Jews were the primary targets of this mercantilist legislation. While numerically few in Europe, Armenians nevertheless loomed large in the French imagination, principally because of their important role in exporting Persian raw silk, a highly prized commodity, but also because in the 1670s they opened some of the first cafés in Paris, in the area of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where customers were surrounded by Turkish decor and black <span title="110" id="calibre_link-1659"></span>
 servers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-843" href="#calibre_link-124" class="calibre6">35</a>
</sup>
 In Marseilles, French merchants feared the competition of Livorno’s Jews, who had established themselves as influential intermediaries with North Africa and the Levant. In 1682, the crown gave in to the pressure of the Chamber of Commerce and expelled all Jews from Marseilles. That the injunction had to be reissued in 1690 and 1758 suggests that a few Jewish merchants continued to operate underground, although their numbers dwindled eventually.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-844" href="#calibre_link-125" class="calibre6">36</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">These conflicts were ongoing while Savary was composing and revising his <em class="calibre4">Parfait négotiant</em>
 . From his place of observation in Marseilles, he not only identified Jews with oligopolies and dishonesty but juxtaposed Jews and Armenians and exaggerated their market power. In so doing, he created a new trope in European commercial literature, one that his sons’ dictionary would crystallize. From now on, Jews and Armenians&mdash;assumed to be cohesive and clearly demarcated groups&mdash;would be frequently mentioned together in Orientalizing travel and commercial literature. In the mid-eighteenth century, David Hume, the Scottish skeptic and champion of the virtues of commerce and moderation, famously rejected the fixity of “national characters” for Europeans, though not for black Africans; for Jews, whom he described as “noted for fraud”; or for Armenians, who were supposedly characterized by “probity.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-845" href="#calibre_link-126" class="calibre6">37</a>
</sup>
 He was not alone in reserving gentler words for Armenians (most of whom were eastern Christians, though some had converted to Catholicism), but they, too, emerged as shady figures in several accounts.</p>
<p class="indent">Savary’s depictions of Armenians and Jews hardly amounted to dispassionate proto-ethnography.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-847" href="#calibre_link-127" class="calibre6">38</a>
</sup>
 He made little effort to identify the many social realities that lay behind the generic terms of “Jews” and “Armenians,” in spite of the fact that such information was available and would have benefited readers in search of advice about how best to conduct their businesses. Different subgroups of Jews and Armenians occupied different niches of the Mediterranean trade and possessed different legal privileges, which in turn affected their ability to enter certain markets. In 1621, for example, Marseilles banned all Armenians and their goods. Yet only fifteen years later, after France signed a peace treaty with the Safavid Empire, Richelieu encouraged Persian Armenians (but not those who were subjects of the Ottoman Empire) to trade with Marseilles. Predictably, Ottoman Armenians looked for opportunities to secure safe-conduct passes and other identification papers that would allow them to be treated as Persians.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-848" href="#calibre_link-128" class="calibre6">39</a>
</sup>
 Religious affiliation mattered too. Catholic Armenians were more welcome in Venice and Livorno than those belonging to the Armenian Church, but they had to conceal their faith in Amsterdam, where Catholics <span title="111" id="calibre_link-1694"></span>
 were banned from worshiping. It is fair to assume that the traders who crisscrossed the Mediterranean were cognizant of the varying religious and political affiliations of the Armenian diaspora and that such information would have been of interest to Savary’s intended readership. <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 , however, overlooked these differences, simply mentioning that Armenians carried silk from Persia to Smyrna and a few resided in Venice. For the most part, it paired Armenians and Jews and referred to both as epitomes of commercial guile.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, tradition and socially constrained perceptions informed Savary’s characterization of merchant groups more than his (limited) direct experience. This was particularly true when it came to non-French and non-Catholic traders. In a chapter devoted to French trade in Egypt, Savary noted that small quantities of Asian goods still arrived in Cairo via caravan routes, and that “Turks, Jews, and Armenians” rushed to buy them and bring them back to the “Turkish Empire.”<sup class="calibre7">

 These groups, he claimed, served as the exclusive intermediaries between French traders and “Arab brokers.” The inflated power Savary attributed to Jews is even more evident in his report that the Egyptian city on the Nile had 4 to 5 million inhabitants, 23,000 mosques, and 12,000 Jewish residents&mdash;all wildly exaggerated numbers.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 ’s mentions of Jews conjured up images of both usurious lenders and almighty merchants. It was against this background that readers made sense of the legend that Savary relayed. Less moralistic in language and tone than Cleirac, Savary nevertheless shared with his predecessor two aims: asserting the honorability of commerce and cordoning off disreputable types of commercial activity from permissible ones. During the quarter century that separated the publication of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 , the boundaries between the feudal aristocracy and the mercantile elite grew more porous. The two-way process of legal and cultural transformation accelerated after the August 1669 decree on the <em class="calibre4">noblesse commerçante</em>
 and demanded the erection of new symbolic benchmarks of commercial morality. Once again, Jews performed an important function in this regard, illustrated by Savary’s mixing of the medieval figure of the usurious Jew with the new Jewish merchants operating in the seventeenth-century Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="indent">In light of what I have said so far, it will not come as a surprise that the two texts that further disseminated the legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange throughout France during the late seventeenth century were legal commentaries on recent royal edicts designed by Colbert. <span title="112" id="calibre_link-1638"></span>
 Philippe Bornier (1635&ndash;1711), a nobleman and royal official in Montpellier, was charged by the king with producing a systematic collection of all recent royal decrees on civil, criminal, and commercial law. His commentary on the 1673 ordinance traced the invention of both bills of exchange (title V, art. 1) and marine insurance (title XII, art. 7) to Jews, borrowing generously from (but not citing) Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 . Bornier reiterated a point made by both Cleirac and Savary: that bills of exchange “are very useful, as long as no one commits any abuse in handling them and they involve real exchange.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-851" href="#calibre_link-131" class="calibre6">42</a>
</sup>
 Building on his university training more than on practical experience, he invoked the distinction drawn by theologians between real and fictive exchanges, that is, between bills employed to transfer funds from one city to another and bills that functioned exclusively as financial instruments, a distinction that Savary had largely abandoned. More than Savary, Bornier also adopted Cleirac’s religiously charged language when speaking of Jews (“leur crimes execrables,” “retirer à la Juive”) and cited Giovanni Villani as an unquestioned authority.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-852" href="#calibre_link-132" class="calibre6">43</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The other legal commentary of those years in which the legend figures prominently was written not at the bequest of the crown but upon the initiative of a commoner, Jean Toubeau, the former head of the merchant guild of Bourges, a town in what was then the province of Berry, in the heart of France. Unjustly overlooked by most scholars, Toubeau’s <em class="calibre4">Les institutes du droit consulaire</em>
 (1682) solely concerned the <em class="calibre4">ordonnance de commerce</em>
 of 1673 and is a key text for understanding the social and legal entanglements of Old Regime commercial society. Dedicated to Colbert, the work vigorously asserted the honorability of commerce and defended the autonomy of merchants’ tribunals against trained justices and lawyers, whom Toubeau denounced as “idolaters of Roman law.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-853" href="#calibre_link-133" class="calibre6">44</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The first part of Toubeau’s treatise was devoted to consular jurisdictions, the definition of a merchant, and noblemen’s involvement in commerce. By the late seventeenth century, noblemen and clergymen were frequently trading or endorsing bills of exchange, but they resented having to renounce their immunities to appear before a merchant judge. To defend the principle established by the 1673 ordinance, according to which the nature of the disputed transaction rather than the status of the parties involved in it determined whether a lawsuit would be adjudicated before a commercial or a civil court, Toubeau turned to legal authorities (jurists like Andrea Alciato, Jacques Cujas, and Sigismondo Scaccia) and to history (notably the cities of Venice and Genoa) in order to demonstrate that commerce was a dignified activity <span title="113" id="calibre_link-1660"></span>
 that was entirely congruent with noble status. He rejected Cicero’s distinction between wholesale and retail trade, arguing that noblemen should feel entitled to engage in all forms of trade. This strong antihumanist position departed from earlier, more conciliatory statements by authors of the <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 and signaled a greater reliance on law than on tradition in legitimizing commerce.</p>
<p class="indent">In the second part of <em class="calibre4">Les institutes du droit consulaire</em>
 , which concerned exchange dealings, Toubeau expressed his impatience with all religious condemnations of credit. Following Savary, he attributed the invention of re-exchange to the Ghibellines who fled Florence for Amsterdam and defended this type of transaction against those, like Maréschal, who had deemed it to be usurious.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-854" href="#calibre_link-134" class="calibre6">45</a>
</sup>
 In spite of his full vindication of commercial credit in its most sophisticated forms, Toubeau still followed in the footsteps of Cleirac, Savary, Bornier, and even Villani (whom he had evidently not read) in maintaining that Jews invented both bills of exchange and marine insurance.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-855" href="#calibre_link-135" class="calibre6">46</a>
</sup>
 Only thirty-five years after the publication of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 and seven years after the first appearance of <em class="calibre4">Le Parfait négociant</em>
 , the legend was thus referenced as a matter of fact.</p>
<p class="indent">Toubeau’s treatment signals the normalization of the legend. In 1690, an authoritative French dictionary repeated it in relation to both marine insurance and bills of exchange without a shadow of a doubt.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-856" href="#calibre_link-136" class="calibre6">47</a>
</sup>
 At the same time, Toubeau’s reference to Jews as inventors of marine insurance was not entirely casual. Questioning the existence of marine insurance in Roman law, he anticipated the trend, especially pronounced among eighteenth-century German and Italian jurists, of searching for the antecedents of credit contracts in Roman law and the classical tradition (<a href="#calibre_link-137" class="calibre6">chapter 7</a>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-857" href="#calibre_link-138" class="calibre6">48</a>
</sup>
 In the short term, however, it was Toubeau’s belief in the legend that attracted attention. A review of his treatise published in the <em class="calibre4">Journal des sçavans</em>
 singled out the Jewish invention of bills of exchange as one of the curious ideas that one could glean from it.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-858" href="#calibre_link-139" class="calibre6">49</a>
</sup>
</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2063">The First Moment of Discontinuity (1690): Refutation</h3>
<p class="noindent">In 1690, in his <em class="calibre4">L’art des lettres de change</em>
 , the first French treatise devoted entirely to bills of exchange, Jacques Dupuis de la Serra made Cleirac’s account the object of a frontal attack&mdash;a measure of the reputation the legend had developed since 1647. Bills of exchange had become so widespread that everyone handled them, the author declared, but they remained “mysterious and only <span title="114" id="calibre_link-1763"></span>
 intelligible to those who specialize in this trade, known as bankers.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-859" href="#calibre_link-140" class="calibre6">50</a>
</sup>
 By his estimation, this informational asymmetry between insiders and outsiders was particularly dangerous when disputes over bills of exchange ended up in appellate courts (<em class="calibre4">parlements</em>
 ), because the judges who presided over these courts, as Cleirac had also noted, were ignorant of the ways in which these instruments worked and therefore often unable to issue fair sentences. To close the gap between the practical knowledge of merchants and the bookish culture of men of law, Dupuis de la Serra went further than any previous author in assembling French and foreign legislation concerning bills of exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">As had become customary, he opened his treatise with a taxonomical distinction between different types of exchange: moneychanging involving foreign coins, four-party bills of exchange, dry exchange, and bills traded at the fairs of Lyon. In the second chapter, he turned to a historical account of the emergence of bills of exchange. Here he departed from his predecessors. Together with a strong assertion of the usefulness of bills of exchange and their unique contractual nature (which differentiated them from usurious loans), Dupuis de la Serra marshaled a robust rejection of the idea that Jews had invented those bills. He agreed with Cleirac only that no comparable contracts had existed in ancient Roman law. Otherwise, he challenged the Bordeaux lawyer on two grounds. First, he reasoned that inventions materialize quickly, not over 600 years, the interval between the expulsion decrees of 640 and 1316 cited by Cleirac and Savary as having inspired Jews to conceive these new credit devices. Second, he stressed the hatred toward Jews that pervaded the periods of their expulsion. According to the legend, the Jewish invention of bills of exchange required the assistance of gentile neighbors who took Jews’ money and property and fulfilled the promise to remit cash payments to them abroad. In Dupuis de la Serra’s view, such relationships of cooperation and trust could not have emerged amid public hostility.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-860" href="#calibre_link-141" class="calibre6">51</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The logic of both objections was persuasive and provided fodder for those wishing to refute the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange in the decades and centuries to come. Not even this challenge, however, delivered the fatal blow to the legend. Dupuis de la Serra argued against the account’s coherence but did not question the reliability of the sources that Cleirac had invoked. Poor source criticism, that is, insulated the legend from further scrutiny. Villani, in particular, was a legitimizing source, and Dupuis de la Serra failed to verify what his chronicle said about the matter. Ironically, Villani, albeit indirectly, was also the inspiration for Dupuis de la Serra’s alternative hypothesis, which credited “those Florentines who had been expelled by the Ghibellines and found refuge in France” with inventing bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-861" href="#calibre_link-142" class="calibre6">52</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="115" id="calibre_link-1699"></span>
 Had Dupuis de la Serra probed the sources he was citing, he would have found that Villani made no such claim about the Jewish invention of bills of exchange and blown Cleirac’s cover. Even so, he corrected Savary’s inflation of the role played by Ghibellines in the instrument’s invention, which rested on a garbled rendering of medieval Florentine history, since the wealthiest bankers had in fact been Guelfs. More significantly, he triggered the first consequential moment of discontinuity in the legend’s reception. Overall, he stressed the uncertainty surrounding the origins of bills of exchange, expressed his preference for attributing their invention to Florentine exiles in France, and reinforced the link between the resourcefulness of refugees and the opportunity bills of exchange offered exiles to move funds surreptitiously under the eyes of their oppressors. We will encounter this theme of the economic ingenuity of persecuted minorities, heralded sometimes in jubilant tones, other times in more somber ones, again later in the book.</p>
<p class="indent">Short and lucid, <em class="calibre4">L’art des lettres de change</em>
 was another publishing hit. Reprinted in seven standalone French editions (1693, 1706, 1750, 1767, 1783, 1789, 1792), it was translated into Latin in 1712 and Italian in 1718, and enjoyed seven more Italian reprints (1740, 1750, 1761, 1772, 1785, 1803).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-862" href="#calibre_link-143" class="calibre6">53</a>
</sup>
 In 1828 it was incorporated into a new edition of Daniel Jousse’s eighteenth-century commentary on the 1673 <em class="calibre4">ordonnance de commerce</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-863" href="#calibre_link-144" class="calibre6">54</a>
</sup>
 It is particularly interesting to note that Dupuis de la Serra was a close collaborator of Savary, and it is to him and to Claude Naulot that we owe the most technical sections of <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 in its revised 1679 edition.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-864" href="#calibre_link-145" class="calibre6">55</a>
</sup>
 Moreover, beginning in 1697, Dupuis de la Serra’s treatise was included at the end of every new edition of Savary’s manual&mdash; another indication that factual consistency was hardly a priority in the <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 , since the two texts offered contradictory accounts of the origins of bills of exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">Dupuis de la Serra’s slim booklet reached a broad audience and planted the seeds of an alternative origin story, one that touted Florentine bankers as the inventors of bills of exchange and resonated especially with Italian and German scholars (<a href="#calibre_link-137" class="calibre6">chapter 7</a>
 ). Remarkably, however, the legend lived on in spite of having being shown to be utterly implausible.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2064">Phase II (1700&ndash;1748): Dissemination</h3>
<p class="noindent">At this point in the story, mentions of the legend become too frequent to be discussed one by one. Two aspects of the second phase in the legend’s dissemination in France are noteworthy, however. While the merchant literature remained the narrative’s primary vehicle of diffusion, the alleged Jewish <span title="116" id="calibre_link-1661"></span>
 invention of bills of exchange (and sometimes marine insurance) began to crop up in texts unrelated to commerce and soon became a cliché more than an occasion for reflection&mdash;a trend that accelerated with the proliferation of serial and encyclopedic works in the eighteenth century. At the same time, this cliché took on different meanings depending on the discursive context in which it was invoked. My interpretative effort therefore consists in examining how the legend squared with other Christian representations of Jews and how a range of symbolic associations between Jews and credit could be combined and recombined over and over to suit changing circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">Predictably, Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Parfait négociant</em>
 became the blueprint for a growing number of handbooks on trade. Its most successful imitation, Samuel Ricard’s <em class="calibre4">Traité general du commerce</em>
 , written and published in Amsterdam, appeared in multiple editions and inspired other French and Dutch writers. Ricard affirmed that bills of exchange belonged to the realm of natural law (<em class="calibre4">droit des gens</em>
 ), rather than to canon or civil law, and judged them to be economically useful and morally legitimate. His brief and sober reference to the Jewish invention of bills of exchange appeared as an uncontested fact alongside praise for Italian contributions to commercial techniques.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-865" href="#calibre_link-146" class="calibre6">56</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">To these ideas inherited from Savary, Ricard added a distinctive Dutch perspective. Channeling a common sentiment, he reserved his praise for Spanish and Portuguese Jews and expressed uncharitable views of Ashkenazim, whom he called by the pejorative names of <em class="calibre4">Tudesques</em>
 (Germans) and <em class="calibre4">Semowfies</em>
 (Smousen) and depicted as engaged in the petty exchange of foreign coins.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-867" href="#calibre_link-147" class="calibre6">57</a>
</sup>
 Eastern European Jewish immigrants to Amsterdam at the time were indeed mostly poor, even if a few soon challenged the primacy of Sephardim in international trade and finance. Here we need to stress that even in the most tolerant of all early modern European cities, the practical commercial literature freely mixed factual statements (Ricard, for example, listed accurately the presence of 375 Christian and 20 Jewish licensed brokers in Amsterdam) with value judgments that reflected received wisdom more than direct observation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-868" href="#calibre_link-148" class="calibre6">58</a>
</sup>
 The net result of this tendency was the widespread belief that different merchant communities enjoyed different degrees of collective credibility.</p>
<p class="indent">In Ricard’s work and a host of other merchant manuals from the early eighteenth century, the legend only merited brief mention. Its appearance was sometimes incidental; other times it was more prominently placed. Sometimes the tale was left uncontested; other times it was accompanied by alternative explanations for the origin of credit instruments.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-869" href="#calibre_link-149" class="calibre6">59</a>
</sup>
 For whatever reason, perhaps because of their concise and parenthetical nature, modern scholars <span title="117" id="calibre_link-1700"></span>
 have overlooked these statements. But their recurrence suggests that they were placeholders for deep-seated associations between Jews and credit that readers at the time would have been quick to spot.</p>
<p class="indent">The second bestseller of the French <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 , the monumental dictionary of commerce compiled by Savary’s two sons, is an excellent guide to the web of references to Jews and credit that pepper this literature. Its primary author was Jacques Savary des Brûlons (1657&ndash;1716), a royal official and inspector-general of manufacturing goods at the Custom House of Paris. After his death, his brother Philémon-Louis Savary (1654&ndash;1727), a cleric and canon of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, a church under royal patronage in the greater Parisian region, completed the work. The first edition of the <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire universel de commerce</em>
 appeared in three volumes between 1723 and 1730 and enjoyed enormous success. It was followed by several expanded and abridged editions in French and was imitated, adapted, and pirated in multiple languages.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-870" href="#calibre_link-150" class="calibre6">60</a>
</sup>
 To assemble their vast compilation, the two brothers drew from multiple sources: unpublished notes left by their father; travel accounts and official government papers ranging from surveys of specific trades and industries (such as spices or textiles) to memoranda (<em class="calibre4">mémoires</em>
 ) written by merchants, sea captains, consuls, and others; legal inquiries (<em class="calibre4">procès-verbaux</em>
 ) relating to commercial and maritime affairs; and finally, a vast printed literature, beginning with their father’s <em class="calibre4">Parfait négociant</em>
 and extending to publications such as Ricard’s <em class="calibre4">Négoce d’Amsterdam</em>
 (1700).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-871" href="#calibre_link-151" class="calibre6">61</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries and encyclopedias became the preferred and authoritative ways of organizing knowledge in the eighteenth century. They were not meant to be read cover to cover, and no matter how clear their programmatic aim and how strict their editorial oversight, they were inevitably inconsistent. The Savary brothers’ dictionary was no exception. Yet with regard to the associations between Jews and credit, it displayed remarkable coherence.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-872" href="#calibre_link-152" class="calibre6">62</a>
</sup>
 References to Jews throughout the dictionary were far more numerous than in <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 . To start, Savary’s sons included an entry for “Jew” that encapsulated the entire discourse that revolved around the term: “Jews have the reputation of being very skilled at commerce but they are also suspected of trading without the maximum of honesty and probity.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-874" href="#calibre_link-153" class="calibre6">63</a>
</sup>
 This perceived combination of commercial acuity and treachery was at the heart of the interlocking stereotypes concerning Jews and helps us identify four themes that characterize the many references to Jews and credit throughout this voluminous dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the Savary brothers used the word <em class="calibre4">usury</em>
 both in a technical sense (lending at interest) and with a generic meaning of economic malpractice. <span title="118" id="calibre_link-1690"></span>
 Both meanings were explicitly linked to Jews, who across multiple entries were described as guilty of charging exorbitant interest rates, hoarding, counterfeit, and deceit. Second, Jews were portrayed as alternately poor and exceedingly wealthy. This dyad had emerged in the sixteenth century and remained a staple of economically motivated anti-Jewish sentiments until the modern period. Oxymoronic only on the surface, it derived its appeal from the notion that both the poor and plutocrats existed on the margins of society and regularly engaged in fraud.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-875" href="#calibre_link-154" class="calibre6">64</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">A third theme connected Jews to all forms of commercial malpractice. The Savary brothers put it starkly: “The word ‘Jew’ has several meanings in relation to commerce, but almost all negative.” Note that the emphasis was on the <em class="calibre4">word</em>
 Jew, that is, on the figurative rather than the sociological qualification of Jewishness. Examples of this usage were included: “A merchant is said to be rich like a Jew when he is believed to have amassed great fortunes, especially if he is suspected of some usurious traffic.” What, then, was “usurious traffic”? A “merchant usurer” was someone who pillaged (<em class="calibre4">rançonne</em>
 ) those he traded with and was called “a real Jew.” It followed that “to fall in the hands of Jews” was to deal with traders who were harsh and tenacious in their negotiations. The Paris guild of secondhand dealers (<em class="calibre4">marchands fripons</em>
 ) was mentioned to illustrate the point: it included many “honest people and good Catholics,” the dictionary declared, but its members were often called “Jews,” either because the populace regarded them as especially duplicitous or because they were suspected of being of Jewish descent.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-876" href="#calibre_link-155" class="calibre6">65</a>
</sup>
 To be a <em class="calibre4">fripon</em>
 was to behave like a Jew regardless of one’s religious affiliation. The term could be applied to all sorts of characters: Greek and Armenian textile workers in Smyrna were said to be <em class="calibre4">grand fripons</em>
 , compelling merchants to put a special seal (<em class="calibre4">boul</em>
 ) on the calicoes they painted to limit the chances of fraud.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-877" href="#calibre_link-156" class="calibre6">66</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth and last, the <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire universel de commerce</em>
 regarded Jews (or, more precisely, certain segments of the Jewish diaspora) as wielding excessive influence in world finance and international commerce and linked this phenomenon to specific policies, including Colbert’s brand of mercantilism. His effort to promote the inclusion of Jews or Armenians, whom he regarded as capable of enriching the royal coffers, unsettled the status quo. In 1615 Antoine de Montchrétien, to whom we owe the expression “political economy,” had struck an early blow to the Aristotelian theory of international commerce by portraying it as an agonistic arena rather than as a system of balance and reciprocity. But Montchrétien was vehemently hostile to all foreigners, whom he regarded as spies and unfair competitors rather than as potential contributors <span title="119" id="calibre_link-1662"></span>
 to the national economy, and he was particularly averse to Jews, whom he saw as pouring into the kingdom with only their own interest at heart.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-878" href="#calibre_link-157" class="calibre6">67</a>
</sup>
 Colbert rejected this vision and attempted to turn exaltations of Jewish economic talents into reasons to grant them special privileges in exchange for their economic services but failed to persuade the commercial elites of Marseilles.</p>
<p class="indent">None of the views relayed by the Savary brothers was new, but they gave more space than previous authors to the different types of Jewish settlements that European rulers permitted in order to take advantage of Jews’ ostensible commercial prowess. Even the “nations that are most ill-disposed toward Jews,” the dictionary explained, were interested in “learning their business secrets and sharing their profits.” The numbers adduced in support of this claim were more reliable (though still inflated) for Amsterdam than for Livorno, with Jews in the former divided into two “tribes”: Portuguese Jews, who were richer, worked as bankers and merchants, and counted roughly 5,000 individuals, and German Jews, who were only 1,200 in number.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-879" href="#calibre_link-158" class="calibre6">68</a>
</sup>
 In Livorno, the Savary brothers wrote, there were “more than ten thousand” Jews&mdash;a figure three times larger than the actual one that they likely derived from the travel literature. According to the <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire</em>
 , Jews controlled the majority of trade in both locations, but those in Livorno were truly hegemonic: they left only 2 percent of the Levant trade to be shared between the French, Italians, Dutch, English, and Armenians residing in the Tuscan port city.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-880" href="#calibre_link-159" class="calibre6">69</a>
</sup>
 Needless to say, this estimate bore no relation to reality.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-881" href="#calibre_link-160" class="calibre6">70</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Livorno posed a greater threat to French expansion in the Mediterranean than Amsterdam did in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. Perhaps this situation, together with the Savary brothers’ reliance on their father’s work, led them to vastly overestimate the role of Livorno’s Jews as intermediaries in the trade with the Ottoman Empire. Who exactly the Savarys thought these Jews were is not clear. They often treated Jewish and Christian subjects of the Ottoman Empire interchangeably. An anonymous <em class="calibre4">mémoire</em>
 on the commerce of Marseilles reprinted in the <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire</em>
 explained that “all trade in Turkey is in the hands of Greeks, Armenians, Jews, and Syrians. These people, oppressed by the Turks, have lost their natural pride, but crushed under the yoke of a rapacious and despotic empire, seek repayments for their misfortunes from foreigners.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-882" href="#calibre_link-161" class="calibre6">71</a>
</sup>
 Muslim indolence and Ottoman despotism were fixtures of the Orientalist discourse that had matured since the publication of <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 (Montesquieu’s <em class="calibre4">Persian Letters</em>
 had appeared to great acclaim in 1721, just two years before the first volume of the Savary brothers’ dictionary was issued).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-883" href="#calibre_link-162" class="calibre6">72</a>
</sup>
 Now the <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire</em>
 added Greeks to the list of merchant groups <span title="120" id="calibre_link-1640"></span>
 from the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean that deceived Westerners and held undue market power.</p>
<p class="indent">As Jews became part of this Orientalist discourse, they morphed into an undifferentiated group, one among other Levantine communities. At the same time, Jews continued to be cast as paragons against whom every phenomenally talented merchant group was to be judged. The leitmotif figured in both French travel and commercial literature, which worked as echo chambers. Only a year after the publication of <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 , the famed Huguenot traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier described Indian moneychangers (<em class="calibre4">Banianes</em>
 ) as “devouring pests and vipers” and “worse usurers than the Jews,” reflecting that they would have swallowed all of Persia’s wealth had the shah not expelled them.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-884" href="#calibre_link-163" class="calibre6">73</a>
</sup>
 A later edition of the Savarys’ dictionary added that “the Banyans and the Chinese are the most important merchants in the [East] Indies, to whom we could add the Jews and the Armenians, who are also scattered everywhere.” The entry went on to claim: “We can associate [Banyans] with Armenians and Jews for their experience and their ability in all sorts of trades.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-885" href="#calibre_link-164" class="calibre6">74</a>
</sup>
 More often, Armenians were dropped from the equation. A French Huguenot exile in Berlin wrote that no people understood commerce better than the Chinese, who for this reason should be referred to as “the Jews of the Orient.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-886" href="#calibre_link-165" class="calibre6">75</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Bankers and traders living in the town of Shamakhi, in today’s Republic of Azerbaijan, near the Caspian Sea, were said to possess such rare financial abilities that they surpassed the Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-887" href="#calibre_link-166" class="calibre6">76</a>

<p class="indent">Scholars who have examined the writings of the Savary family or used them as sources of information about the history of European trade and merchant culture have neglected their multiple references to Jews. In fact, the figure of the Jew was essential to definitions of market ethics, if only because Jews served as abstract referents that exemplified improper behavior. In some cases, they also marked the proper boundaries of state commercial policies. The interlaced themes of the Savarys’ dictionary illustrate that utility, a positive and necessary principle for any ruler, had to be weighed against usury, the most negative of all attributes of Jews and a wickedness from which Christians were not immune. In spite of its didactic tone, none of the literature produced by <span title="121" id="calibre_link-1825"></span>
 the elder Savary or his sons explained just how to achieve the proper balance between utility and usury.</p>
<p class="indent">By now, the difficulty of defining this elusive equilibrium should not surprise us. Arguments about the morality of commerce during this time were made through associations rather than precise demarcations, and such associations proved long lasting. Since the late Middle Ages, the notion of Jewish usury had been linked to Jews’ ostensibly antisocial behavior and exclusion from the Christian covenant. These presumptions informed the entire spectrum of stereotypes about Jewish economic roles, ranging from the image of Jewish moneylenders choking Christian borrowers sanctioned at the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council to the figure of the all-powerful Jewish merchant forged in the seventeenth-and eighteenth-century Mediterranean and even the theme of Jewish pauperism that was emerging in central and eastern Europe. Political pragmatism allowed Jews a new and special space in those cities of Europe where Sephardim were welcomed with the expectation that they would boost trade and finance. But this newly gained position only applied to a subset of the Jewish diaspora and, more importantly, never counteracted a persistent source of hostility toward the entire group. Precisely because they were allegedly so skilled, Jews were bound to be perceived as trespassing the boundaries of the physical and symbolic spaces assigned to them.</p>
<p class="indent">The images of Jews that we find in the early modern French commercial literature absorbed and elaborated on widespread religious motifs. The symbiosis of religious and economic infidelity was crystallized in an episode recounted in the so-called “courtroom literature,” which collected and commented on both famous and obscure trials. One of the first to experiment with this genre was the lawyer and polymath François Gayot de Pitaval (1673&ndash;1743), who assembled accounts of a vast number of sensational trials in a collection titled <em class="calibre4">Causes célèbres et interessantes</em>
 . The first edition appeared in twenty volumes between 1734 and 1743, and was reprinted in multiple formats. Among the notable trials selected for inclusion in this collection was that of Raphäel Levi, sentenced to death for ritual murder in Metz in 1670.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">Pitaval in this work for the first time embedded the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange in an account of blood libel, the ultimate crime of which Jews were accused.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-891" href="#calibre_link-170" class="calibre6">80</a>

 Cleirac had hinted at the analogy between usury and the desecration of the host (and thus ritual murder, since in Catholic doctrine the consecrated host is the body of Christ) through his reference to Villani (<a href="#calibre_link-3" class="calibre6">chapter 2</a>
 ). Transposed to the northeastern region of France, the analogy <span title="122" id="calibre_link-1857"></span>
 became explicit. Echoing the language of Canon 67, Pitaval maintained that “these abominable Jews” committed “all sorts of impieties” and oppressed Christians “with their excessive usuries” in times of both war and peace. He described in detail a scheme for fooling local peasants into buying low-quality horses imported from Germany as an instance of “the usuries and pillages perpetrated by the Jews of Metz.”<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">
<em class="calibre4">Causes célèbres et interessantes</em>
 left behind the buoyant port cities of Bordeaux and Marseilles to situate the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange in Lorraine, where Jews were impoverished and segregated, and mostly made a living as lenders to the poor peasants who despised them. Pitaval also resurrected the name of Giovanni Villani, which the Savarys had elided and which was indirectly tied to ritual murder. In the same years during which <em class="calibre4">Causes célèbres et interessantes</em>
 first appeared, more enlightened philosophes portrayed Jews as sympathetic victims of the Inquisition and used blood libels as weapons of anticlerical propaganda even as they continued to indulge in spiteful representations of rabbinical Judaism and Jewish society (<a href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre6">chapter 6</a>
 ). <em class="calibre4">Causes célèbres et interessantes</em>
 did not embrace this antipapal agenda, constructing instead the most sinister version of the legend to date, one that did not become mainstream but arguably found an audience, especially among the legal professionals who were its principal readers.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2065">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Depicted by the Annales school as a century of famines, deflation, and rebellions, the French <em class="calibre4">grand siècle</em>
 long suffered bad press among economic historians. More recently, scholars of the seventeenth century (particularly Anglo-phones) have insisted on a portrayal focusing less on pauperization and more on the degree of commercialization that all strata of French society experienced during this time. The peasantry, once believed to have been caught in a perpetual Malthusian trap, has emerged from this revisionist literature as capable of rational economic decisions.<sup class="calibre7">

 Even the least prosperous French men and women did not live autarkic lives. According to a study of marriage and property disputes among families <span title="123" id="calibre_link-1862"></span>

</sup>
 In short, noblemen, bourgeois, artisans, peasants, and peddlers, whether in remote rural villages or in thriving coastal cities, all grew dependent on the thick economic networks linking Paris to the provinces and the entire kingdom to its colonial outposts.</p>
<p class="indent">What mechanisms existed at this time to match creditors and lenders? How were those who possessed capital able to evaluate a potential borrower’s reputation? Merchant handbooks like those by the elder Savary dispensed practical instructions on how to minimize risk&mdash;for example, by tending to one’s accounts and correspondence&mdash;while also outlining in broad strokes the profile of a virtuous merchant and his opposite: Jews and Armenians. The little attention that economic historians have paid to these stereotypes suggests that they regard them as irrelevant to the period’s mercantile culture, mere vestiges of the religious prejudice of the time. In fact, the recurrence of these stereotypes in early modern commercial literature was neither casual nor superfluous. A presumed homology between religious and economic trustworthiness informed works such as those by the Savary family, in which Jews and non-Catholics symbolized economic guile. Not normally considered a source for the study of European attitudes toward Jews, in reality these early texts of the “science of commerce” reveal the extent to which old and new clichés about Jewish usury informed the culture of early modern European merchants.</p>
<p class="indent">By the late seventeenth century, the word “Jew” in France carried an array of meanings, all hostile in tone, that could be applied to individuals who were not themselves Jewish. They ranged from the medieval trope of the Jewish pawnbroker and rag dealer to the figure of the omnipotent Jewish merchant who undercut his competitors in the Levant. Antoine Furetière’s dictionary asserted that “by a man rich like a Jew, we mean a very rich man.” It added that “we call usurer a merchant who cheats or extorts, [or we call him] a Jew, because Jews are notable usurers, double-dealers, and deceptive” (“usuriers, frippiers, &amp; trompeurs”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-897" href="#calibre_link-177" class="calibre6">86</a>
</sup>
 The same dictionary proposed an expansive definition of usury that encompassed not only the charging of interest (following the strictest precept of canon law) but also “an illicit profit that derives from using money in ways contrary to the laws.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-898" href="#calibre_link-178" class="calibre6">87</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The definition was hardly clear-cut. Civil laws defined usury in the context of noncommercial loans (<em class="calibre4">rentes</em>
 ) but were famously vague in all other respects (<a href="#calibre_link-4" class="calibre6">chapter 3</a>
 ). The 1673 <em class="calibre4">ordonnance de commerce</em>
 , which Savary was instrumental in drafting, forbade merchants from building interest rates into the principal <span title="124" id="calibre_link-1701"></span>
 when issuing bills of exchange and from charging compound interest (title VI, arts. 1&ndash;2), but both infractions were difficult to detect and reflected practices so common as to make the law meaningless. Regrettably, no systematic studies have been done on commercial litigation in Old Regime France. Judging from existing collections of jurisprudence, however, the adjudication of disputes over bills of exchange remained contentious and was complicated by a lack of firm criteria.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-899" href="#calibre_link-179" class="calibre6">88</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In any case, a punitive judicial system cannot be the only foundation for a commercial society. Written and unspoken norms also guide merchants’ behavior. In early modern France, inevitably some merchants tested the normative consensus and the reach of the law when they acted in bad faith. At the time of Savary’s composition of <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 , Colbert’s mistrust of merchants was inspiring highly centralized commercial policies, including the creation of a network of royal inspectors charged with reporting back to Paris. Ultimately, it was impossible for the state to control every production site and marketplace in the kingdom. Top-down regulation anywhere requires internalized cultural norms of conduct in order to achieve its intended aims. In this fragile institutional environment, merchant manuals and legal commentaries spelled out not only the written rules of conduct, but also a broader range of shared values necessary to sustain the operations of respectable and successful <em class="calibre4">négociants</em>
 . These works combined advice and prescriptions with spurious information, including anecdotes that served as warnings. Such was the function of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, a poignant narrative meant to convey the dangers that lurked behind the exceedingly complex financial instruments on which the market increasingly relied.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurtured by prejudice, the legend was canonized by some of the very works of Europe’s <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 that imparted practical teachings on how to succeed as a <em class="calibre4">négociant</em>
 . It even survived almost intact the objections raised in 1690 by Dupuis de la Serra, who exposed serious flaws in the story. Savary’s credentials were undoubtedly greater than Dupuis de la Serra’s, although the latter also enjoyed remarkable success. A fertile cultural terrain supported the legend’s diffusion. Accusations about the usurious character of Jews issuing bills of exchange could even be introduced in court as aggravating charges, as happened in Toulouse in 1745.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-900" href="#calibre_link-180" class="calibre6">89</a>
</sup>
 Although the most influential and reckless treasurers of eighteenth-century France&mdash;John Law (1671&ndash;1729), Samuel Bernard (1651&ndash;1739), and Jacques Necker (1732&ndash;1804)&mdash;were all Calvinists, and thus controversial in their own right, moralizing tales about the destructive character of credit more often centered on Jews. The fate of Bernard, the single <span title="125" id="calibre_link-1695"></span>
 largest financier of the crown during the War of Spanish Succession, is emblematic in this regard. As France’s mounting public debt led to a dramatic currency depreciation and lenders ceased to accept Bernard’s bills of exchange, rumors spread that he was Jewish (a false claim facilitated by Huguenots’ frequent use of Old Testament names). Through a dazzling series of textual distortions and cross-references, which began with a comment by Voltaire, Bernard was turned into the iconic figure of the devious Jewish banker who undermined the well-being of the state in order to enhance his own interests.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-901" href="#calibre_link-181" class="calibre6">90</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The transformation of the figure of the Jewish usurer into that of the Jewish financier unfolded against the backdrop of the general diffusion of the paper economy. Local context, too, colored the process. The works of Savary father and sons placed the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange in the context of changing power dynamics in the Mediterranean. French trade in the Levant was on the ascent in the last quarter of the seventeenth century, especially after 1673, when the crown brokered a more advantageous diplomatic and commercial treaty with the Ottoman Empire than those negotiated by rival European powers. Marseilles, France’s foremost Mediterranean port and Savary’s window onto the world of overseas trade, was dear to Colbert but resisted his plans for the settlement of foreign communities there. In 1669, the same year that the edict promoting the greater involvement of noblemen in overseas trade was enacted, Colbert granted exclusive control over French trade in the Mediterranean to the Chamber of Commerce of Marseilles, which thereafter also elected the French consuls who assumed diplomatic roles in North Africa and the Middle East.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-902" href="#calibre_link-182" class="calibre6">91</a>
</sup>
 This oligopolistic body, which represented the interests of local shipowners, wholesale merchants, and bankers, opposed Colbert’s desire to attract Jews and Armenians to Marseilles and ultimately won.</p>
<p class="indent">The figure of the dominant Jewish merchant who allegedly cheated and outmaneuvered the <em class="calibre4">négociants</em>
 of Marseilles was a Provençal variant on a widespread theme. Once again, existing tropes about Jews and commerce were adapted to local conditions and contingent struggles. Far from being mere ways of speaking, inimical representations of minority groups also provided a rationale for exclusionary legislative measures. Representations of Jewish and Armenian traders as unfair competitors were in line with the xenophobic commercial policies promoted by the Chamber of Commerce of Marseilles, which was fiercely jealous of its sphere of influence. Five years after Jews were expelled from Marseilles, Armenians who were Ottoman subjects were <span title="126" id="calibre_link-1663"></span>
 forbidden from selling silk (their principal trading item) there on the grounds that their textiles were of inferior quality.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-903" href="#calibre_link-183" class="calibre6">92</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Jews were seen as more threatening than any other minorities because many assumed that their wicked habits could contaminate the rest of society. In Cleirac’s tale of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange, the real danger was that “Lombards and Cahorsins” were imitating Jews’ worst behavior. The logic reverberated with particular strength in Bordeaux, where crypto-Judaism was an institutionalized phenomenon, but it appealed to Christians’ imagination the world over. In the 1670s, an anonymous report addressed to the municipal government of Marseilles described Jewish merchants as practicing usury, employing counterfeit currencies, and overcharging customers. To these accusations, it added a more damaging claim: the presence of Jews “Judaified” young men in Marseilles to the “disgrace of our religion.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-904" href="#calibre_link-184" class="calibre6">93</a>
</sup>
 This example shows that the specter of Judaism could be invoked as an argument for regulation in the commercial sphere even in places where crypto-Judaism was not a lived reality.</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of many objections, Colbert hoped to persuade the Chamber of Commerce of Marseilles of the utility of enticing Jews and Armenians to settle there. His plan was neither unique nor radical. Livorno, Marseilles’ main rival, was only one among other European port cities, including Venice, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and London, that had given Jews (particularly those fleeing Iberia) exceptional privileges on account of their perceived commercial and financial competence. The reason of state arguments that inspired these policies became so widely accepted that Jewish leaders learned to spin them to their own advantage. In Venice, Rabbi Simone Luzzatto (1583&ndash;1663) penned the best-known early modern defense of Jewish commerce and successfully fended off an impending decree of expulsion. To persuade the Senate of the republic of the Jews’ utility to the state, he inflated their economic contribution by more than doubling the number of Jewish residents in the city (to 6,000, from the actual number of 2,400) and used the resulting number as the multiplier for his estimates of the taxes and custom duties that he claimed Jews paid.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-905" href="#calibre_link-185" class="calibre6">94</a>
</sup>
 More-over, Luzzatto reasoned, Jews were more valuable and less ominous than other communities of foreign merchants because they lacked the backing of a state and could not wage military or commercial wars on their own: because they were not in direct competition with Catholic subjects of the republic, they could only help them flourish. Shortly thereafter, the Amsterdam rabbi Menasseh ben Israel (1604&ndash;1657) adopted an analogous strategy to plead with <span title="127" id="calibre_link-1696"></span>
 Oliver Cromwell to readmit Jews to England in 1655&ndash;1656&mdash;a request that was tacitly granted.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-906" href="#calibre_link-186" class="calibre6">95</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">At this mid-seventeenth-century moment, it was reasonable for Colbert to argue for the benefits of inviting foreigners to settle in Marseilles. He likely assumed that the corporatist structure of Old Regime France and the system of royal oversight would tame any potential disruption generated by the contractual equality he would extend to Jewish and Armenian merchants. But it appears that he underestimated the backlash generated by the legal and social reforms that he had set in motion, reforms that chipped away small but significant building blocks of the very corporatist architecture designed to distinguish a merchant from a nobleman, a foreign merchant from a native guild member. The city’s commercial elites were thus placed on the defensive. In this conflict, Marseilles could count on more than its fierce municipal tradition to oppose Colbert’s plan. Advocates of economic protectionism also marshaled widely held religious stereotypes as weapons of resistance. Jews and Armenians could open doors in the Levant, these opponents argued, but could they be contained&mdash;or would they insinuate themselves among the upstanding <em class="calibre4">négociants</em>
 of the free port that Colbert wished to create? Commercial credit and, more than any other instrument of the sort, bills of exchange epitomized the voluntaristic character of a commercial society in which the economic power of an individual mattered more than his personal status. The disruption they engendered was more than financial: it went to the heart of ingrained notions of hierarchy and authority, including political authority, as the next chapter will show.</p>

<h2 class="chtitle2">Between Usury and the “Spirit of Commerce”</h2>
<p class="noindent">
<span class="small1">TWO DATES DOMINATE THE</span>
 history of French Jews in the eighteenth century: January 28, 1790, and September 27, 1791. In the span of eighteenth months, for the first time in the history of Europe, Jewish men acquired the same civil and political rights as their non-Jewish peers. A small fraction of the population of the kingdom (some 35,000, or 0.125 percent of all inhabitants), Jews on the eve of the Revolution loomed far larger in the French collective imagination than their demographic presence warranted. Hardly a homogenous group, French Jews formed a mosaic of different communities, each with its own traditions, privileges, and degrees of acculturation to Christian society. We have already encountered the richest, though not the largest, Jewish group living in and around Bordeaux, a group prominently represented among the merchants involved in the Atlantic trade. These Sephardic traders were also the French Jews who most adopted the habits and manners of their Catholic peers. By contrast, their more numerous brethren in Alsace and Lorraine were largely confined to peddling and small-scale moneylending in the countryside, were frequently accused of practicing usury, and lived more insular lives. Paris had only a tiny Jewish community, which was not distinguished by particular cultural or economic achievements, and the poorest of the Jews of Avignon sought better fortunes in Bordeaux to no avail. One of the questions this chapter addresses is the extent to which these different social realities informed new iterations of the legend and the views of advocates and opponents of the expansion of Jewish rights.</p>
<p class="indent">Emancipation was a watershed moment in both Jewish history and the history of Western liberalism. By conferring formal equality in the legal and <span title="129" id="calibre_link-1707"></span>
 political order on a group long deemed unworthy of it, it reshaped the meaning of Jewish identity. Treatments of Jewish emancipation, however, are quite different in the historiography of European Jewry and that of France. Accounts of the Jewish past almost invariably pause at emancipation, while most studies of the French Revolution relegate it to a footnote.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-907" href="#calibre_link-281" class="calibre6">1</a>
</sup>
 This split is curious. A great deal of ink has been spilled on the fact that women did not achieve equality during the Revolution and African slaves in the French Caribbean were freed only temporarily. Historians rightly take eighteenth-century conceptions of women and blacks and, more recently, the interplay of gender and race as illustrations of the patent limits of the notions of progress and universalism conceived by the Enlightenment and the Revolution.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-908" href="#calibre_link-282" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
 Jews rarely figure in this early history of human rights, but their fate is instructive. Compared to women and the black population of the French colonies, adult Jewish men of some means gained the most from the Revolution. The process through which a group that for centuries had been regarded as inimical to Christian society came to be granted civil and political rights therefore sheds light on the contradictions of the nascent egalitarianism of the revolutionary period.</p>
<p class="indent">Among scholars of European Jewish history, emancipation remains a controversial topic. Most studies concentrate on its consequences for Jewish life, notably the restructuring of the institutional relations between the state and Jewish organizations, the changing place of religion in Jewish self-definition, and the false promises that formal equality made to those Jews who sought to assimilate. No less relevant and contentious is the question of how Jews came to be perceived as worthy of equality&mdash;that is, the social and intellectual changes that led to this turning point. Most historians today favor a gradualist interpretation and insist on the variety of paths emancipation followed across Europe. Within this camp, an influential argument emphasizes the politics of commerce espoused by certain western European states, France included, as the principal driver of integration of segments of the Jewish diaspora into Christian society. David Sorkin argues that for the “port Jews” of Sephardic extraction, who in the course of the eighteenth century developed cultural traits and a legal status that set them apart from their Ashkenazic brethren, emancipation was “not a rupture or radical departure but merely a completion of a process that had begun two centuries before.” The Sephardic Jews of southwestern France are a case in point because they “were already living beyond the autonomous community in merchant corporations or voluntary communities” and therefore “gained emancipation <span title="130" id="calibre_link-1845"></span>
 through a confirmation of their existing privileges” rather than by the removal of legal disabilities.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-909" href="#calibre_link-283" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">My reading of the place occupied by the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange in eighteenth-century French debates puts this gradualist thesis to the test. It does so not only by considering alternative interpretations of Jewish history, but also by bringing French and Jewish history to bear on one another more than has been done so far.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-910" href="#calibre_link-284" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
 Now that the anti-Marxist impetus that dominated the revisionist historiography on the French Revolution during the last quarter of the twentieth century has lost steam, the economic life and institutions of Old Regime France have sparked new interest, especially among Anglophone historians. Like earlier work, however, this recent scholarship overlooks the roles that Jews played in the marketplaces of the kingdom and in eighteenth-century economic thought.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-911" href="#calibre_link-285" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">What I propose in this chapter should prompt historians of Jewish emancipation to square the faith they often place in commerce as a driving force in the transition from toleration to equality with the limited and contentious scope that commercial interests played in revolutionary rhetoric.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-912" href="#calibre_link-286" class="calibre6">6</a>
</sup>
 Historians of the French Enlightenment, for their part, will find that depictions of Jewish economic roles test the inclusivity of the Enlightenment trope of commerce as sociability. A number of eighteenth-century French authors regarded commerce as a capacious category that transcended mere economic exchanges and, in its broadest sense, represented bonds of sociability that, though compatible with absolutism, cut across geographical frontiers and legally sanctioned social ranks. Even when singled out as the spinners of far-flung commercial webs, Jews remained marginal to this Enlightenment portrait of commercial society, and no debate ensued about the degree to which Jewish merchants actually belonged to those voluntary, interest-based associations that were said to foster new bonds between strangers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-913" href="#calibre_link-287" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">To recover the centrality of Jewish emancipation to the history of the Revolution demands not only that we examine how Enlightenment concepts of commerce fared once the hierarchical society to which they were tailored came tumbling down, but also that we consider the fears that newly emancipated Jews elicited. In so doing, we can appreciate the extent to which Jewish emancipation served as a litmus test for the Revolution as a whole insofar as this event marked the formal transition from a society of status (in which an individual’s rights and obligations were tied to the corporate group to which he was assigned, usually at birth) to a society of contract (in which, in principle, <span title="131" id="calibre_link-1814"></span>
 every eligible man was free to enter into contract with other equally free male individuals and to choose from a large menu of contractual choices). Rival visions of Jews and of commerce, I wish to show, are excellent guides for reassessing the inconsistencies of this transition and its longer-term legacies.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter hinges on two moments: the reworking of the meaning of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange by Montesquieu in the 1740s and the debates on emancipation that occurred during the last quarter of the century. I argue that the discursive and political contexts in which the legend was evoked account for the vastly different meanings that it acquired at those two moments. Montesquieu praised Jews for forging new credit instruments that benefited everyone because he assumed that Jews inhabited a society of status that kept them in a subordinate position. When equality emerged later in the century as a concrete and, for some, desirable possibility, Jewish commercial and financial dexterity was once again perceived as a threat rather than a boon to state and society. On the eve of the Revolution, both friends and enemies of Jews depicted them as burning with the desire to extract excessive profits from Christians, even as they differed about whether any remedy for this moral failing was possible.</p>
<p class="indent">While Montesquieu drew a sharp line between commercial credit and usury, the two were conflated once again during the emancipation debates, as they had been in Cleirac’s commentary. The prospect of legal equality once again made Jews an emblem of the disruptive character of credit, and particularly of oligopolies. Baptism had rendered Jewishness invisible in societies that prized clearly demarcated religious boundaries. Citizenship now rendered Jews legally indistinguishable in a political and economic order that proclaimed its preference for individualism over corporatism but in fact remained wary of the leveling of differences it had produced.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the scope of my inquiry, I focus on Christian representations of Jewish economic roles, with a nod to the responses that they elicited from a few Jewish writers and community leaders.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-914" href="#calibre_link-288" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
 I show that eighteenth-century Christian views of Jewish commerce and usury developed at the intersection of discursive traditions and the lived experience of different Jewish communities in France. Montesquieu’s positive characterization of Jewish commerce owed at least something to the more inclusive Bordelais context. His more generous disposition did not endure once it was transplanted into a different time and place a quarter century later. At this time, acrimonious debates about <span title="132" id="calibre_link-1776"></span>
 the civic and political status of Jews broke out not in and around Bordeaux, but in the northeastern regions of France, where masses of poor Jews and a few wealthy moneylenders and army contractors were regarded by the Christian population as exploitative usurers. The economic side of the emancipation debates thus brings to the fore yet another configuration of a Christian discourse in which Jews symbolized the hidden dangers of credit markets in which contractual equality masked an a priori power differential between economic actors.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2066">The Second Moment of Discontinuity (1748): Montesquieu</h3>
<p class="noindent">Two books of Montesquieu’s <em class="calibre4">Spirit of the Laws</em>
 were devoted to commerce, and one to money. Additional reflections about how the economy intersected with politics, society, and culture peppered the entire work. Book XXI described the history of commerce from antiquity to the (then) present. A climactic turning point appeared in chapter 20, which bore the dramatic title “How Commerce Broke Through the Barbarism of Europe” (“Comment le commerce se fit hour en Europe à travers la barbarie”) and traced the waning of medieval anti-usury sentiments and the rise of <em class="calibre4">l’esprit de commerce</em>
 (“the spirit of commerce”). Around the time of Europe’s first transoceanic voyages, Montesquieu wrote, commerce ceased to be “the profession only of mean persons,” and thus the exclusive province of “a nation covered with infamy” (by which he meant Jews), and “re-entered . . . the bosom of probity.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-915" href="#calibre_link-289" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
 In this account, Jews were the frontrunners in the transformation of commerce from a despised occupation associated with usury and moneylending to a dignified and valuable activity. In this way they spearheaded a veritable political and cultural revolution through which commerce, for the first time, “became capable of <em class="calibre4">eluding violence</em>
 ” (XXI, 20, my emphasis). (I draw attention to the words “<em class="calibre4">eluding violence</em>
 ” because in the course of the chapter, we will see that they played a particularly important rhetorical function.)</p>
<p class="indent">How were Jews able to engineer such a monumental transformation and bequeath to Europe a modern, safe, and secular commercial society? To this complex question, Montesquieu gave a deceptively simple answer: “The Jews invented letters of exchange” (XXI, 20). Scores of scholars, many imbued with great learning, have read this statement, yet very few have reflected on its meaning. Studies of Montesquieu have generally glossed over it.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-916" href="#calibre_link-290" class="calibre6">10</a>
</sup>
 There are various reasons for this neglect: the relative marginality of Jews and Judaism <span title="133" id="calibre_link-1673"></span>
 in Montesquieu’s thought, a general disregard for these themes among mainstream scholars of the French Enlightenment, and a deep investment in the irenic and inclusive quality of <em class="calibre4">doux commerce</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-917" href="#calibre_link-291" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
 Even specialists of Montesquieu’s economic thought normally treat his mystifying statement as a self-evident assertion that requires little more than some paraphrasing. They spend more time on other subjects, such as Montesquieu’s opposition to the nobility’s involvement in trade, his critique of mercantilism (“jalousie sur le commerce”), his preference for commercial over territorial empires, and his contrast between “commerce de luxe” (which he regarded as typical of monarchies) and “commerce d’économie” (a feature of republics). Those who cite Montesquieu’s passage about the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, regardless of their ideological tendencies, do so incidentally or without inquiring into its sources.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-918" href="#calibre_link-292" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">One name stands out in this scholarly landscape: that of Albert Hirschman, the first modern critic to draw attention to Montesquieu’s claim about the Jewish invention of bills of exchange and to make it a cornerstone of his reading of <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 as a case for commerce as a check on despotism and unbridled passions.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-919" href="#calibre_link-293" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
 By virtue of his own biography, Hirschman may have been more predisposed than others to recognize the pride of place that, uncharacteristically for his time, Montesquieu assigned to Jews in his narrative of the civilizing process. Yet even Hirschman displays little interest in probing the provenance of Montesquieu’s statement about the Jewish invention of bills of exchange or the reception it may have had. Rather, he uses it to support his strikingly original reading of <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 , which emphasizes the nexus between anti-authoritarian politics and commerce as a prefiguration of the interdependence of democracy and capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">The evidence uncovered in this chapter will question this reading. For now, as further testament to the divergent patterns of French and Jewish historiography, we may note that Montesquieu’s passage relaying the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange has drawn more attention from historians of early modern Jews, who treat it as evidence that Montesquieu was one of the few eighteenth-century French philosophes sympathetic to Jews, than from scholars in any other field.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-920" href="#calibre_link-294" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
 When, in 1968, Arthur Hertzberg made the controversial case for the Enlightenment roots of modern antisemitism, he also singled out Montesquieu as a skeptical anti-Voltaire, a philosophe benignly predisposed toward Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-921" href="#calibre_link-295" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 Subsequent studies of the French Enlightenment’s engagement with Jews and Judaism have taken issue with Hertzberg’s portrait and offered more nuanced interpretations of it, but these works have also <span title="134" id="calibre_link-1777"></span>
 contributed little to our understanding of Montesquieu’s view of the relationship between Jews and the spirit of commerce.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-922" href="#calibre_link-296" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In modern critical scholarship, therefore, Montesquieu’s contention that “Jews invented letters of exchange” is treated alternately as too obvious or too enigmatic to engage. By now, however, we know that these words contain more than meets the eye and that they would not have passed unnoticed at the time. The footnote that Montesquieu added in support of his assertion will ring all too familiar to readers of this book: “It is known that under Philip Augustus and Philip the Tall, the Jews who were chased from France took refuge in Lombardy, and that there they gave to foreign merchants and travellers secret letters, drawn upon those to whom they had intrusted their effects in France, which were accepted” (XX, 20, note <em class="calibre4">o</em>
 ). By introducing his corroborating evidence with the turn of phrase “it is known,” Montesquieu was not merely adopting a common rhetorical device. The legend, we now realize, had been in circulation for a whole century when he reiterated it. While the prevailing standards for attribution at the time did not demand that he offer a bibliographical reference, it is clear that <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 provided Montesquieu with the gist of the story.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-923" href="#calibre_link-297" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
 And yet the spin he gave to it was utterly new.</p>
<p class="indent">
<em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 introduced the second moment of discontinuity in the legend’s reception, one that was more disruptive than Dupuis de la Serra’s refutation of its credibility (<a href="#calibre_link-298" class="calibre6">chapter 5</a>
 ). Attention-grabbing stories and influential authors are a combustive mix, no less so when the stories are specious. Montesquieu lent his authority to the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, but he also altered its meaning. Gone were the didactic aims of Cleirac and Savary, intended to draw a line between shady speculators and upright merchants. By inventing bills of exchange, Montesquieu posited, Jews introduced new dynamism into Europe’s economy and became harbingers of modernity. By devising a credit instrument that enabled them to outsmart their oppressors, they resisted persecution and curbed the reach of despotism. Thanks to these bills, “commerce . . . became capable of <em class="calibre4">eluding violence . . .</em>
 ; the richest merchant having none but invisible effects, which he could convey imperceptibly everywhere he pleased” (XXI, 20, my emphasis).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-925" href="#calibre_link-299" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">A putatively Jewish invention, we are told, engineered a cultural and political revolution that altered the course of European history. A despot, perhaps seeking to placate popular anti-Jewish sentiments, might have been tempted to confiscate land, homes, ingots, or cargoes, but not pieces of paper that he could not redeem. Once limited in their ability to plunder, princes realized <span title="135" id="calibre_link-1806"></span>
 that they “should govern with more prudence than they themselves could ever have imagined”; thus might Europe “be cured of Machiavelism” (XX, 20). Meanwhile, the church, which equated commerce with “knavery,” lost its grip on society and “the Theologians were obliged to limit their principles” (XXI, 20). With the rise of the spirit of commerce, moderation triumphed in the spheres of government and social mores: “Happy is it for men that they are in a situation in which, though their passions prompted them to be wicked, it is, nevertheless, to their interest to be humane and virtuous” (XXI, 20).</p>
<p class="indent">Montesquieu’s account of the emergence of commercial society in this chapter of <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 proved extremely influential in France and abroad in two primary ways. First, it provided the most authoritative rendition of the theory of <em class="calibre4">doux commerce</em>
 , which supporters repeated over and over and critics derided no less insistently. The chapter was in many respects a rebuttal of <em class="calibre4">The Adventures of Thelemachus</em>
 (1699), a novel written by the Archbishop of Cambrai, François de Salignac de La Mothe-Fénelon, that has been deemed “the most read literary work in eighteenth-century France (after the Bible).”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-926" href="#calibre_link-300" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
 Montesquieu shared with Fénelon a disdain for the Machiavellianism of Louis XIV and his entourage but lacked Fénelon’s nostalgia for ancient agrarian republicanism. Second, <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 outlined a chronology of European history that gained enormous traction, pitting a dark medieval past against the increasing progress of what today we call the early modern period. Montesquieu did not dwell on precise dates (his reference to Philip Augustus and Philip the Tall would place the invention of bills of exchange between 1180 and 1322, while the gist of his narrative clearly postpones it to a later moment), but the picture he painted leaves no doubt that he viewed the Middle Ages as a period dominated by the barbarian invasions, Scholasticism, economic stagnation, and tyrannical rulers. An enemy of the Roman Church, he portrayed medieval Catholic doctrine as hostile to all profit-seeking enterprises. Needless to say, this picture left a deep mark on scholarly and popular understanding of both the Middle Ages and the Jewish past.</p>
<p class="indent">With no small touch of irony, Montesquieu placed Jews at the center of his narrative of the triumph of the spirit of commerce over medieval Christian obscurantism. For Cleirac 100 years earlier, the supposedly historical account of how Jews devised marine insurance and bills of exchange to protect their assets forged a link between medieval usury and seventeenth-century commercial credit. For Montesquieu, who glorified commercial credit, bills of exchange became the antithesis to, rather than the sequel of, the pawnshop. As such, after the publication of <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 , they began to figure <span title="136" id="calibre_link-1718"></span>
 alongside the three great inventions of the printing press, the compass, and firearms that, following Francis Bacon, were said to have made the modern world.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-927" href="#calibre_link-301" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
 Proponents of the Napoleonic Code of Commerce would later describe the invention of bills of exchange, whether by Jews or by Florentines, as “comparable to the discovery of the compass and of America.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-928" href="#calibre_link-302" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
 Opponents of Montesquieu’s thought were even quicker to seize on his words. The Sorbonne theologians found the entire chapter in which they appeared so scandalous that they demanded its expurgation. At issue was both Montesquieu’s disparagement of medieval church views of the economy and his casting of Jews not just in a positive light, but as <em class="calibre4">dei ex machina</em>
 behind the creation of a new European commercial society in which credit flowed freely, secure from government prying.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-929" href="#calibre_link-303" class="calibre6">22</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Montesquieu’s rendition of the oft-repeated legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange must have appeared as novel to eighteenth-century readers as Machiavelli’s nonreligious definition of <em class="calibre4">virtù</em>
 had appeared to readers of <em class="calibre4">The Prince</em>
 200 years earlier. Jews, however, were incidental to Montesquieu’s valorization of the spirit of commerce, and they remained so in all other arguments in which he deployed them. In 1723, two years after the appearance, to great acclaim, of the <em class="calibre4">Persian Letters</em>
 , the Jews of Bordeaux were officially allowed to practice their religion. There is no doubt that Montesquieu was acquainted with some of these individuals and met other Jews during his travels.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-930" href="#calibre_link-304" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
 In the three-quarters of a century that followed the publication of Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 , fears of religious dissimulation continued to haunt Catholic believers, but crypto-Judaism in reality progressively declined. During the years that Montesquieu served in the city’s <em class="calibre4">parlement</em>
 (1716&ndash;1726), Jews “were coming into the open,” ceasing to marry in church or baptize their children.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-931" href="#calibre_link-305" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 Meanwhile, Bordeaux became France’s chief Atlantic port together with Nantes and one of Europe’s main commercial hubs. There, New Christians and New Jews, alongside native Catholic and Huguenot merchants and resident Dutch, English, and Hamburgers, built large commercial houses and the most well-to-do absorbed the <em class="calibre4">rentiers</em>
 ’ habits of conspicuous consumption.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-932" href="#calibre_link-306" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
 These merchants of various religions and confessions endorsed each other’s bills of exchange and underwrote each other’s marine insurance as a matter of course.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-933" href="#calibre_link-307" class="calibre6">26</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Without reducing the novelty of Montesquieu’s version of the legend to a reflection of this reality, we can still suspect that the important economic roles played by Jewish merchants in his native Gascony and the social standing that some of them achieved influenced his views. However, his version of the legend did not signal an all-embracing appreciation of Jews by either Montesquieu <span title="137" id="calibre_link-1630"></span>
 or his followers. Unlike Voltaire, whom Ronald Schechter has described as “obsessed with the Jews,” Montesquieu had only a side interest in the subject.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-935" href="#calibre_link-308" class="calibre6">27</a>
</sup>
 But like Voltaire and other philosophes, from time to time, Montesquieu, too, drew from his understanding of Jewish history and religious books to marshal anecdotes in the service of his critique of European history and culture. Using a technique already tested in the <em class="calibre4">Persian Letters</em>
 , Montesquieu in <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 put his harshest indictment of the Iberian inquisitions in the mouth of an imaginary Portuguese Jew who allegedly witnessed the burning at the stake of “an eighteenth-year-old Jewess” in Lisbon (XXV, 13).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-936" href="#calibre_link-309" class="calibre6">28</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Aside from this well-known vignette, references to Jews in <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 are few and far between, if generally sympathetic. The ancient Israelites, following Josephus, are said to have been an agricultural nation, the opposite of the Phoenicians (XXI, 6)&mdash;an argument that Christian reformers would deploy later in the century as evidence of the possibility of “regenerating” a people that had not always devoted itself to usury.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-937" href="#calibre_link-310" class="calibre6">29</a>
</sup>
 In only one other instance did Montesquieu refer to the plight of Jews as evidence that commerce was incompatible with despotism. In Russia, he wrote, all subjects of the empire were forbidden from conducting any import and export trade, and the expulsion of Jews in 1745 followed accusations that they were smuggling money out of the country and to those banished to Siberia by means of bills of exchange (XXII, 14). Blind despotism, Montesquieu intimated, was a cause of economic underdevelopment.</p>
<p class="indent">The evaluation of Jews’ economic functions across Montesquieu’s works is not consistent. The <em class="calibre4">Persian Letters</em>
 indulged in stereotypes about Jews’ unchanging nature and avarice while also praising their diminishing persecution in Europe.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-938" href="#calibre_link-311" class="calibre6">30</a>
</sup>
 In addition to containing conflicting judgments, Montesquieu’s oeuvre is also full of missed opportunities. The relationship between commerce and toleration is never discussed specifically with respect to Jews. Some of the most oft-quoted lines from <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 are emblematic of the theory of <em class="calibre4">doux commerce</em>
 : “Commerce is a cure for the most destructive prejudices; for it is almost a general rule, that wherever we find agreeable manners, there commerce flourishes; and wherever there is commerce, there we meet with agreeable manners” (XX, 1). The phrasing is powerful and the thesis famous, but readers are left guessing who the victims of these “destructive prejudices” are and how exactly self-interest curbs those prejudices. Allusions make room for expansive and ideologically laden readings.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-939" href="#calibre_link-312" class="calibre6">31</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Alongside its admiration for the effects of commerce, <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 also registered certain qualms. Elaborating on a motif then in wide circulation, <span title="138" id="calibre_link-1810"></span>
 Montesquieu expressed no doubt that “the history of commerce is that of the communication of people” (XXI, 5). But commerce could also tear apart the social fabric, he noted: mercantile societies often lacked hospitality, asking monetary compensation for what used to be offered for free (XX, 2). An astute observer and privileged nobleman, Montesquieu expressed his staunch opposition to the <em class="calibre4">noblesse commerçante</em>
 for both political and ethical reasons (V, 8; XX, 21&ndash;22). “Commerce,” he pronounced resolutely, “is the profession of equal people” (V, 8).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-940" href="#calibre_link-313" class="calibre6">32</a>
</sup>
 Fully immersed in the society of orders of his time, Montesquieu embraced a concept of equality that meant equality of rank, rather than wealth. Merchants’ fortunes, as he realized, could vary enormously. But even more than the nobility’s oligopolistic position, he abhorred the idea that commerce might erode traditional hierarchies and aristocratic honor.</p>
<p class="indent">Departing from more conventional interpretations, some scholars insist that Montesquieu feared both the excesses of consumption and “the spirit of extreme equality” into which democracy could degenerate (VIII, 2).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-941" href="#calibre_link-314" class="calibre6">33</a>
</sup>
 This is also how certain noblemen read Montesquieu at the time. In a petition addressed to Marseilles’ city government, the nobility of the sword, which had been excluded from power in favor of the local commercial elite in 1660, demanded reinstatement in the municipal council, noting that, as “the author of the <em class="calibre4">Spirit of the Laws</em>
 has written, ‘in countries where people are moved solely by the spirit of commerce, they sacrifice everything humane, all moral virtues.’”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-942" href="#calibre_link-315" class="calibre6">34</a>
</sup>
 This is a fair citation of passages that are not normally highlighted in modern scholarship on Montesquieu, which tends to stress the positive rather than the detrimental consequences of the spirit of commerce.</p>
<p class="indent">Where does all this leave us with regard to the Jews? Did Montesquieu conceive of those in his own Bordeaux as “equal people” within commercial society even if, for example, they were barred from leadership positions in the city’s Chamber of Commerce? And in his view, did Sephardic merchants, like all Jews allegedly, “display for their religion an obstinate, invincible loyalty which borders on fanaticism,” or were they full participants in “the communication of people”?<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-943" href="#calibre_link-316" class="calibre6">35</a>
</sup>
 Montesquieu never pursued these questions because, as even an admirer of his views on Jews admitted, he “was fundamentally not interested in Jews as such, but only to the extent that they provided him startling examples of the relationship between intolerance and proselytism.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-944" href="#calibre_link-317" class="calibre6">36</a>
</sup>
 In this indifference, Montesquieu was hardly alone. Voltaire was only the most eloquent of the philosophes who invoked Jews for the purpose of making abstract pronouncements about commerce as an engine of religious toleration, in spite of his antipathy toward Jews and Judaism. His <em class="calibre4">Lettres philosophiques</em>
 of <span title="139" id="calibre_link-1641"></span>
 1734 contained an iconic description of the London Royal Exchange as a place where “representatives of all nations gather for the utility of mankind; there, the Jew, the Mohammedan and the Christian behave towards each other as if they were of the same religion, and reserve the word ‘infidel’ for those who go bankrupt.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-945" href="#calibre_link-318" class="calibre6">37</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Literary critic Erich Auerbach, writing in exile from Nazi Germany, noted that Voltaire’s vignette “was not really written for a realistic purpose,” but rather “to insinuate certain ideas” about the subordination of religious belonging to the logic of the market.<sup class="calibre7">

 In the same vein, Montesquieu’s rendering of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange was more concerned with offering a vivid critique of despotism and the Catholic Church than engaging with the actual status of Jewish merchants or interrogating the role of commerce in Jewish history. The moral of his tale was thus bounded by a political order that made no space for equal rights for Jews.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2067">Phase III (1748&ndash;1775): Bifurcation</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the aftermath of <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 , the legend’s textual transmission split along two paths. Some authors absorbed Montesquieu’s interpretation of the alleged Jewish role in propelling the development of a commercial society in which bills of exchange linked merchants together in defiance of despotic rulers. Others followed in the footsteps of Cleirac and Savary, portraying Jews as having invented an instrument that allowed ill-intentioned merchants to accumulate wealth by duplicitous means. A boom in serial publications and an expansion of the reading public facilitated the diffusion of both strands of this story, which occasionally merged in surprising ways.</p>
<p class="indent">Diderot and D’Alembert’s <em class="calibre4">Encyclopédie</em>
 illustrates all these trends vividly. With some 74,000 entries written by more than 130 contributors, this grand intellectual project inevitably fell short of consistency. In the <em class="calibre4">Encyclopédie</em>
 the legend appeared in reference to both marine insurance and bills of exchange, in both abbreviated and extended form, and sometimes accompanied by an endorsement and other times by doubts or revisions.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-948" href="#calibre_link-321" class="calibre6">40</a>
</sup>
 Among the entries that mentioned the legend, two relied mostly on Montesquieu and one primarily on Cleirac and Savary. The entry for “Lettre de change,” authored by Antoine-Gaspard Boucher d’Argis, a noted lawyer whose writings were used in the failed attempt to exonerate the Huguenot merchant Jean Calas in an infamous trial in 1762, borrowed from both <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">Le parfait</em>
 <span title="140" id="calibre_link-1788"></span>
 <em class="calibre4">négociant</em>
 , lifting entire sections from each. Boucher d’Argis raised questions about the legend’s truthfulness, but in the end he did not embrace the objections proffered by Dupuis de la Serra about the narrative’s plausibility. Instead, after acknowledging the inconsistencies in the historical account of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, he concluded: “It would nonetheless be difficult to imagine that the Jews did not take any precautions to salvage their goods when fleeing to Lombardy&mdash;something that could only be accomplished by means of bills of exchange. Therefore, there are reasons to believe that they were the first inventors of these instruments.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-949" href="#calibre_link-322" class="calibre6">41</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This passage reveals how Jewish cunning was the one attribute that no one disputed. For Boucher d’Argis, the legend contained a kernel of truth because he assumed that Jews possessed superior economic skill. His readers appreciated the comparison that he left implicit: other groups had been subjected to expropriation before, but the Jews were “the first” to have devised the means to “salvage their goods.” Dupuis de la Serra had questioned the historical account passed on by Cleirac on logical grounds. Boucher d’Argis proceeded in the opposite way: he recognized several flaws in that historical account but found part of its logic unassailable. The compromise he reached is instructive of a broader trend: in the second half of the eighteenth century, the Enlightenment’s emphasis on the historical and circumstantial causes of Jews’ economic shrewdness coexisted with a belief in their essential character as wily speculators.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-950" href="#calibre_link-323" class="calibre6">42</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The other two entries in the <em class="calibre4">Encyclopédie</em>
 that recounted the legend with regard to bills of exchange instead bore Montesquieu’s imprint: they used the tale to denounce the exploitative policies of arbitrary rulers and to exalt the ingenious resistance of a persecuted minority. Both François Véron de Forbonnais’s entry on “commerce” and Chevalier Louis de Jaucourt’s “Juif” depicted the Middle Ages (“the barbarous centuries”) as a time when trade was in the hands of Jews, referring to them as “a wandering people” and as “infamous usurers,” respectively. But if Forbonnais treated Jews as incidental to the rise of commerce, Jaucourt praised their skills and art of survival in the face of oppression and embraced the mainstream position of defenders of Jewish rights: external constrictions rather than natural proclivity explained why Jews flocked to commerce, an economic activity that Christians loathed.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-951" href="#calibre_link-324" class="calibre6">43</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Curiously, Forbonnais and Jaucourt were even more adamant than Montesquieu in singling out Jews’ financial inventiveness compared to other trading communities that suffered persecution. The <em class="calibre4">Persian Letters</em>
 foreshadowed the sociological theory of “middleman minorities,” merchant groups that <span title="141" id="calibre_link-1850"></span>
 strove to be indispensable to those societies that denied them full opportunities.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-952" href="#calibre_link-325" class="calibre6">44</a>

<a id="calibre_link-953" href="#calibre_link-326" class="calibre6">45</a>
</sup>
 No close comparison between Jews and other trading communities figured in any of these authors’ works. Rather, skillfully elaborating on Montesquieu’s ideas, Jaucourt penned a passage that the consortium of printers who owned the rights to this and associated publications reproduced several times. It is worth citing the segment in full because of its curious fate:</p>
<p class="blockquote">In the end, constantly expelled from every country, they [the Jews] found the ingenious means to save their fortunes and to ensure their withdrawals. Banned from France under Philip the Tall in 1318, they found refuge in Lombardy and there, they gave merchants letters drawn upon those to whom they had entrusted their goods before leaving, and these letters were settled. The admirable invention of bills of exchange was born out of desperation and only thanks to them was commerce able to <em class="calibre4">elude violence</em>
 and sustain itself across the globe.<sup class="calibre7">

 The passage even appeared in a spurious entry on Jews in several posthumous editions of Voltaire’s <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire philosophique</em>
 , which, in four loosely related sections, meshed together antiquarian knowledge with tendentious readings of the Bible to produce a baffling account of the alleged absurdity of Jewish rites and the obtuseness of Jewish people. Buried amid derision and hostility was an ambivalent appreciation of Jews’ commercial prowess, contained mostly in the third section (“On the dispersion of Jews”) and derivative of Montesquieu’s thought in both argument and form. Though inauthentic, the entry is consistent with Voltaire’s negative views of Spain as a place where the Catholic Church and the nobility despised Jews and commerce alike. However, while its admiration for the purported Jewish invention of bills of exchange fits with Voltaire’s belief in Jews’ commercial aptitude, the passage is first and foremost a careless repetition of an authoritative cliché.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">The legend revealed once again its protean qualities. The spurious text attributed to Voltaire radiated contrarian meanings, but its putative author’s <span title="142" id="calibre_link-1872"></span>
 fame ensured that the echoes of this sketchy and untenable historical account traveled fast and widely. More generally, during the second half of the eighteenth century, admirers of Montesquieu followed him in evoking the legend without making scornful reference to Jews. But since they trusted their muse, they also did not question his reliability. The massive and incredibly popular <em class="calibre4">Histoire philosophique et politique des deux Indes</em>
 (1770) incorporated the legend as transmitted by Montesquieu in order to press one of its favorite themes, the triumph of ingenuity over church superstition.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-958" href="#calibre_link-330" class="calibre6">49</a>
</sup>
 In a contemporaneous “universal history” presented as the collective labor of <em class="calibre4">une société de gens de lettres</em>
 , the legend resurfaced in the narrative of the massacre of the Jewish community of Munich in 1285. The authors defended the innocence of the Jews emphatically and depicted avarice as a Christian crime, portraying commoners, clergymen, and ruling authorities as blinded by their hatred of Jews and their desire to seize Jews’ wealth. The legend was thus reframed as a tale of survival and Jewish inventiveness: when armed Christians stormed Jewish homes ready to steal their belongings, all they found were slips of paper&mdash;the bills of exchange that Jews had devised in order to protect their assets; given that they could not redeem those bills, the Christian looters had to live with the shame of having killed for nothing.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-959" href="#calibre_link-331" class="calibre6">50</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Intent on using the legend as a redemptive allegory, Montesquieu’s followers showed little interest in disputes over its veracity and repeated it in all sorts of genres, including memoirs and travel accounts.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-960" href="#calibre_link-332" class="calibre6">51</a>
</sup>
 By contrast, the French commercial and legal literature of the second half of the eighteenth century propagated a more negative view of Jewish usury, derived from the accounts of Cleirac and Savary, while also cultivating doubts about the tale’s accuracy and offering alternative narratives of the invention of medieval financial instruments. An authoritative commentary on the 1681 <em class="calibre4">ordonnance de la marine</em>
 published in 1760 oscillated between confirming the assertion by Franz Stypmann (1612&ndash;1650), a leading writer of maritime law, that marine insurance first emerged in medieval Italy and following the common view according to which “the Jews, who are usurers by nature,” invented marine insurance and used it to make inequitable loans.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-961" href="#calibre_link-333" class="calibre6">52</a>
</sup>
 Jews’ usurious character was often taken for granted in the literature on commerce. Cleirac had captured this belief in a dictum that resurfaced in the eighteenth century: in the Levant, he wrote, “Jews, Turkish merchants, Armenians, Persians, Arabs, those from Alexandria and the Moors” charged so-called “lunar interests.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-962" href="#calibre_link-334" class="calibre6">53</a>
</sup>
 Since lunar months are slightly shorter than those of the Gregorian calendar, the expression indicated the charging of higher interest rates than normal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="143" id="calibre_link-1842"></span>
 Meanwhile, an antiquarian search for the earliest documentary evidence of medieval marine insurance and bills of exchange further undermined the legend, with France’s leading Roman law jurist, Robert Joseph Pothier (1699&ndash;1772), presenting textual evidence from classical antiquity and the Middle Ages that challenged its validity.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-963" href="#calibre_link-335" class="calibre6">54</a>
</sup>
 Other sources of growing skepticism were natural law accounts of the emergence of commerce. Those for whom necessity was the mother of invention found it superfluous to search for an individual or group responsible for any pathbreaking innovation. Following this logic, the need to make payments at a distance and mitigate the risks of long-distance trade spurred a spontaneous development of new solutions to address those needs. One comprehensive treatise on marine insurance dismissed as futile the debate over whether Italians or Jews had contributed most to the creation of marine insurance, “a contract that was born out of the nature of things.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-964" href="#calibre_link-336" class="calibre6">55</a>

 A few sixteenth-century Italian authors had already described these credit instruments as the result of cumulative and collective knowledge rather than the genius of a single people.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-965" href="#calibre_link-337" class="calibre6">56</a>

</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, by the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the legend was in wide circulation and was being subjected to considerable scrutiny. More than anyone else, Montesquieu gave it a new and positive meaning by linking commerce to toleration. However, when the debate on Jewish emancipation erupted in the French public sphere, the legend reappeared in an older, less favorable light.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2068">Phase IV (1775&ndash;1791): Usury, the Spirit of Commerce, and Emancipation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Hertzberg maintains that in the late eighteenth century, “Montesquieu was consistently quoted by all those who were on the side of the Jews.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-968" href="#calibre_link-339" class="calibre6">58</a>
</sup>
 In fact, Montesquieu’s influence over the debates on emancipation was more ambiguous. Jews’ involvement in moneylending and commerce became a touchstone in those debates as they unfolded in the northeastern regions of France during the last quarter of the eighteenth century. In that environment, which was quite unlike that of southwestern France, where Montesquieu had recast the legend in positive terms, Cleirac’s and Savary’s cautionary tales of the pernicious effects of Jewish usury still resonated.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="144" id="calibre_link-1645"></span>
 Demands to extend full civic rights to Jewish men were first voiced in earnest during the 1770s in Alsace and Lorraine, and provoked no small outcry. The largest portion of France’s Jews (roughly 30,000 individuals) resided in this region. Their economic status and social makeup differed markedly from those of the Jews in Bordeaux. Never forced to conceal their religious identity, Franco-Ashkenazim spoke Yiddish, maintained their religious traditions, and were limited in their economic and legal freedoms. They were banned from all cities, except Metz, unless they paid a humiliating personal transit tax. Forbidden from owning real estate, cultivating the land, joining craft guilds, or hiring non-Jewish help, most of them lived in small enclaves in the countryside and earned their living as peddlers, moneylenders, sellers of used goods and clothes, or workers in the cattle trade; only the most affluent were involved in provisioning the army with horses and other necessities.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-969" href="#calibre_link-340" class="calibre6">59</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In these adverse circumstances, the earliest gentile advocate of Jewish rights was also the most radical. In 1775, Pierre-Louis Lacretelle (1751&ndash;1824), an audacious lawyer and later a moderate revolutionary, called for the full equality of Jews as men (<em class="calibre4">hommes</em>
 ) and as subjects of the kingdom (<em class="calibre4">régnicoles</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-970" href="#calibre_link-341" class="calibre6">60</a>
</sup>
 Less bent than others on demanding that Jews be “regenerated,” he nonetheless advocated passing special laws to limit Jews’ economic activities.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-971" href="#calibre_link-342" class="calibre6">61</a>
</sup>
 Although Lacratelle denounced the contemporary public hatred of Jews, he attributed it in no small part to their practice of usury and <em class="calibre4">friponnerie</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-972" href="#calibre_link-343" class="calibre6">62</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">A catchword used by both Cleirac and the Savarys, the term <em class="calibre4">fripon</em>
 became a staple of all eighteenth-century gentile descriptions of Jews’ economic roles, regardless of the author’s ideological leaning. A <em class="calibre4">fripon</em>
 was a rogue or, as a period French-English dictionary defined it, “an unworthie fellow, one that useth, or is given to, base trickes, and . . . hath no inclination to any goodness.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-973" href="#calibre_link-344" class="calibre6">63</a>
</sup>
 Bernard Mandeville’s <em class="calibre4">Fable of the Bees, or, Private Vices, Public Benefits</em>
 (1714) was rendered into French as <em class="calibre4">La fable des abeilles, ou, Les fripons devenus honnestes gens</em>
 . In Antoine Furetière’s dictionary (1690), a <em class="calibre4">fripon</em>
 was someone who could not be trusted (“fourbe, qui n’a ni honneur, ni foi, ni probité”) but also a near synonym for Jews, described as “great usurers, cheaters, and double-dealers” (“les Juifs sont de grands usuriers, frippiers, &amp; trompeurs”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-974" href="#calibre_link-345" class="calibre6">64</a>
</sup>
 The recurrence of the terms <em class="calibre4">fripon</em>
 and <em class="calibre4">friponnerie</em>
 in eighteenth-century French references to Jews is significant because it underscores the constraints that language imposed on the emergence of a counterdiscourse premised on a more positive relationship between Jews and credit.</p>
<p class="indent">If the words “usury” and <em class="calibre4">friponnerie</em>
 were invariably conntected to Jews, “commerce” and “credit” were not, as evidenced, for example, in the definitions <span title="145" id="calibre_link-1840"></span>
 of these terms in contemporary French dictionaries. In the economic reality of the time, Jews could be pawnbrokers, lending on collateral to the poor, or merchants negotiating bills of exchange for the conduct of long-distance trade. In the discursive themes of the time, by contrast, Jews belonged almost exclusively to the former domain. The medieval characterization of usury as an antisocial economic activity monopolized by religious infidels persisted, even as the term acquired a more secular connotation of “illicit profit.” Arguing that the spirit of commerce could tame a despotic monarch in a society of orders, Montesquieu could point to Jews as the origins of the new spirit without questioning established hierarchies. However, once egalitarian demands grew louder, the champions of Jewish rights were at pains to distinguish between usury and commerce and not at all inclined to attribute to Jews a positive role in initiating the development of commercial society.</p>
<p class="indent">For Lacretelle, the sorry state of French Jews compared unfavorably with that of the Jews of Holland, parts of Italy and Germany, and especially the American colonies, where “commerce brought them a bit closer to the ordinary human condition,” making them “more honest and more faithful in their dealings.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-975" href="#calibre_link-346" class="calibre6">65</a>
</sup>
 In revising his works for posterity, Lacretelle stressed this point by turning to a familiar subject: the legend, as recounted by Montesquieu.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-976" href="#calibre_link-347" class="calibre6">66</a>
</sup>
 Yet even Lacretelle, who attributed to commerce a more positive role than later supporters of Jewish civic and political rights, failed to uphold French Sephardim as models. His plea for Jewish civic rights anticipated the unresolved tension between moneylending and commerce that would characterize all emancipation debates. “Usury,” Lacretelle wrote, “seems to have made Jews, at all times, into its loyal agents.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-977" href="#calibre_link-348" class="calibre6">67</a>
</sup>
 As he reasoned, Jews had been banned from artisanal and commercial activities because Christians feared competition; as a result, Jews had specialized in moneylending, which had corrupted their moral fiber. Here and there, Lacretelle held up the Sephardim as proof of the beneficial effects of commerce, but he did so tangentially and without conviction. More often, he associated Jews with retail trade and moneylending.</p>
<p class="indent">The thread that linked seventeenth-century philosemitic mercantilism to Montesquieu’s <em class="calibre4">doux commerce</em>
 became looser and looser as the emancipation debates progressed. In actuality, Jewish lending activities in Alsace had little in common with their critics’ portrayal of them. Notarial records show Jews to have been a minority among the creditors in the region, even if they were overrepresented among rural moneylenders.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-978" href="#calibre_link-349" class="calibre6">68</a>
</sup>
 In spite of these facts, Christian resentment against Jewish moneylending in Alsace ran deep. In 1777&ndash;1778, a crown official with an aversion to Jews and a gift for inflammatory rhetoric <span title="146" id="calibre_link-1631"></span>
 named François-Joseph-Antoine Hell engineered an unprecedented defamation campaign against the region’s Jews. He persuaded Alsatian peasants not to repay their debts to Jews and distributed forged receipts attesting to the extinction of those debts.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-979" href="#calibre_link-350" class="calibre6">69</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The ease with which Hell seized on peasants’ hatred of Jewish moneylenders alarmed the Alsatian Jewish leader Cerf Berr (1730&ndash;1793), who hired a Prussian civil servant with radical inclinations, Christian Wilhelm von Dohm (1751&ndash;1820), to pen the most vigorous defense to date of Jewish civic and political rights. Dohm recommended that Jews shift their economic endeavors away from trade and toward manufacturing and agriculture.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-980" href="#calibre_link-351" class="calibre6">70</a>
</sup>
 A century earlier, the ecclesiastical historian Claude Fleury had expressed admiration for the simple life of ancient Israelites, whom he believed had been devoted to cultivating the land in Palestine, while condemning the corruption, greediness, and duplicity of postexilic Jews in the diaspora.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-981" href="#calibre_link-352" class="calibre6">71</a>
</sup>
 By the 1780s, this narrative had become a leitmotif among gentile backers of Jewish rights.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-982" href="#calibre_link-353" class="calibre6">72</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Dohm depicted the Middle Ages in terms not dissimilar to Montesquieu’s, describing them as a time when church persecutions had forced Jews into shameful businesses, but, unlike Montesquieu, he did not attribute to Jews the ability to free society at large (or themselves, for that matter) from the evil effects of their specialization in the moneyed economy thanks to the invention of bills of exchange. Only after the fall of the Roman Empire, Dohm wrote, did the Jews turn to commerce. Though the byproduct of persecution, overspecialization in commerce meant that fraud and usury became distinctive traits of the Jewish character.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-983" href="#calibre_link-354" class="calibre6">73</a>
</sup>
 In order to “cure this corruption,” Dohm proposed not only to open all professions to Jews, but also to institute specific measures to “distance Jews from the <em class="calibre4">profession of commerce</em>
 and to seek to lessen its influence on their character.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-984" href="#calibre_link-355" class="calibre6">74</a>
</sup>
 In Jonathan Karp’s analysis, Dohm decried Jews’ concentration in mercantile professions “not because he was opposed to commerce per se but because . . . he believed that commerce was too important to be left to Jews.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-985" href="#calibre_link-356" class="calibre6">75</a>
</sup>
 In this view, a universalist commercial society was one in which Jews neither held an oligopolistic position nor tainted gentiles involved in the same activities.</p>
<p class="indent">This reading, however, obscures the blurring of commerce and usury in Dohm’s seminal text. Although a deist, Dohm was deeply influenced by Christian theological and popular notions that saw usury as the antithesis of commerce, which was understood as a social bond, and reaffirmed the Jews’ exclusion from French society. If Dohm blamed centuries of harassment for “the moral depravity of Jews,” he also depicted the effects of harassment in familiar <span title="147" id="calibre_link-1722"></span>
 terms: a Jew could not be “a good citizen, a sociable fellow” (“un bon citoyen, un homme sociable”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-986" href="#calibre_link-357" class="calibre6">76</a>
</sup>
 Echoing a thirteenth-century trope, he added: “Their [the Jews’] character tends to lead them to commit usury and fraud in commerce. . . . [T]heir religious biases render them asocial.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-987" href="#calibre_link-358" class="calibre6">77</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">A critic of the deleterious influence that commerce supposedly exerted on the collective character of Jews, Dohm did not celebrate the Sephardim. He borrowed from a Sephardic author the belief that Jews “were the first to establish banks” in Bordeaux and Bayonne but buried the statement in a footnote and did not otherwise praise Sephardic commercial talent.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-988" href="#calibre_link-359" class="calibre6">78</a>
</sup>
 The same statement would resurface in other texts in the years to come, but no author linked Montesquieu’s version of the legend to the idea that Jews founded the first banks in southwestern France in order to downplay the equation of Jews and usury or to argue that Jews’ financial contributions benefited the country at large.</p>
<p class="indent">Dohm’s pamphlet provided the blueprint for the French-language debates that ensued, and particularly for the submissions to an essay competition sponsored by the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences in Metz in 1785, a contest that Hertzberg calls “the central event in the battle of opinion [about Jews] in the last years before the Revolution.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-989" href="#calibre_link-360" class="calibre6">79</a>
</sup>
 The competition took as its theme the question: “Are there ways of making the Jews more useful and happier in France?” There were three winners: Claude-Antonie Thiéry, a Protestant barrister from Nancy; Zalkind Hourwitz, a Polish Jew who had recently immigrated to Paris and would soon be hired by the Bibliothèque du Roy as an interpreter of Oriental languages; and Abbé Henri Grégoire (1750&ndash;1831), a priest who later overshadowed the other two. All three concurred that education and economic activities were vital tools to “regenerate” Jews and thus make them eligible for full citizenship.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-990" href="#calibre_link-361" class="calibre6">80</a>
</sup>
 All three also associated Jews with usury. The only Jewish voice, Hourwitz, boiled down all Christian accusations against Jews to two: usury and <em class="calibre4">friperie</em>
 (“they are usurers &amp; <em class="calibre4">fripons</em>
 because they are oppressed”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-991" href="#calibre_link-362" class="calibre6">81</a>
</sup>
 The latter term and its cognates also appeared frequently in Grégoire’s moral characterization of the Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-993" href="#calibre_link-363" class="calibre6">82</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">All advocates of emancipation conceived of Jewish usury as a product of history rather than nature, but none of them made a concerted effort to distinguish between commerce and moneylending. Thiéry lamented that Jews “soon forgot their primitive simplicity and renounced life in the fields in favor of arts and commerce.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-994" href="#calibre_link-364" class="calibre6">83</a>
</sup>
 In a chapter titled “In What Manner the Jews Became a Commercial People and Usurers,” Grégoire repeated the narrative that ancient Israelites had been farmers, declaring that they had even “neglected <span title="148" id="calibre_link-1632"></span>
 commerce, though they inhabited a maritime country, abounding with excellent harbours.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-995" href="#calibre_link-365" class="calibre6">84</a>
</sup>
 Postexilic Jews, according to this account, had been forced into commerce, and commerce had corrupted them. Here commerce was no longer, as in Montesquieu’s narrative, the steppingstone toward a new, less rapacious and divisive form of sociability, and bills of exchange were no longer the antithesis of medieval usury.</p>
<p class="indent">When Grégoire resurrected the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, he was aiming to cast Jewish economic talents in a thoroughly negative light. His was no casual remark. So resolved was Grégoire to assert the legend’s authenticity that he went out of his way to dismiss alternative accounts pointing to Florentines or Germans as the inventors of bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-996" href="#calibre_link-366" class="calibre6">85</a>
</sup>
 Borrowing Montesquieu’s phrase, he maintained that by inventing bills of exchange, Jews could “<em class="calibre4">elude violence</em>
 and support themselves by means of riches almost invisible.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-997" href="#calibre_link-367" class="calibre6">86</a>
</sup>
 But the meaning he attributed to the phrase was unlike that which Montesquieu had intended. Rather than benefiting commercial society as a whole, for Grégoire, this invention furthered the interests of Jews alone. Jewish commerce was usurious because it fulfilled an egotistic purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">Born to a modest family in a small village in Lorraine, Grégoire keenly felt the plight of the peasantry, who railed against Jewish moneylenders.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-998" href="#calibre_link-368" class="calibre6">87</a>
</sup>
 In his appropriation of the legend, he turned Montesquieu’s narrative on its head and demonstrated that Cleirac’s earlier rendering remained alive. In fact, the entire section of Grégoire’s <em class="calibre4">Essay</em>
 devoted to Jews’ economic activities was in many ways a dialogue with Montesquieu. For the priest, during the Middle Ages commerce was synonymous with Jews: “Every commercial resource was found naturally in their hands.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-999" href="#calibre_link-369" class="calibre6">88</a>
</sup>
 While he emphasized the harms caused by Christian persecution, he also described Jews as possessing (or having developed&mdash;the reasoning is unclear) qualities that over time became innate, such as “a thirst for gain,” “an acuteness which in an instant could see what profits were to be made,” and a “genius for calculation” (<em class="calibre4">génie calculateur</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1000" href="#calibre_link-370" class="calibre6">89</a>
</sup>
 Secular authorities who deprived Jews of alternative means of livelihood in the interest of securing their financial services were to blame for Jews’ association with commerce, but the fact remained that Jews “worship no other idol but money, and are infested with no other leprosy but usury.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1001" href="#calibre_link-371" class="calibre6">90</a>
</sup>
 Like other fervent partisans of Jewish rights before and after him, Grégoire easily slipped into essentialized views of Jewish economic cunning at the same time that he sought to undo them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="149" id="calibre_link-1807"></span>
 In a subtle rebuttal of Montesquieu, Grégoire volunteered “a remark, which no person, perhaps, [has] ever yet made,” namely, that as Christians began to engage in commerce in the late Middle Ages, they provided competition for the Jews and thus reined in “the robbery of the Jews.” As the pursuit of profit became acceptable among Christians, “security” and “sincerity” came to be increasingly valued because of their importance in guaranteeing respect for contractual obligations. Among Christians, he added, the spirit of commerce led to the development of a self-policing commercial society: “The rays of reason, enlightening the mazy path of usury, taught the people to be on their guard against the frauds of the usurer.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1002" href="#calibre_link-372" class="calibre6">91</a>
</sup>
 For reasons that Grégoire did not elucidate, the spirit of commerce did not transform Jews in the same way. His logic echoed earlier hostile views of Jews as rivals of Christian merchants. But now, with the ascent of nationalism, these arguments acquired new potency. If all merchants were suspected of being unpatriotic (“the merchant, become a citizen of the world, . . . is seldom a zealous patriot”), Jews were unredeemable: rootless people (“not attached to the soil”), they would be perceived as always willing to sell out to the highest bidder.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1003" href="#calibre_link-373" class="calibre6">92</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This was a different sort of cosmopolitanism from the one captured in Voltaire’s romanticized description of the London Royal Exchange, and one with considerable purchase. In 1767, in a corporatist defense of their privileges against the incursion of Jews, the representatives of the six guilds of Paris, an ancient institution that still wielded some influence, defined usury as the tool Jews used to oppress Christians (after all, the Bible allowed Jews to charge interest to non-Jews). As a result, Jews were said to be unable to join any other “nation” because their aim was always to dissolve rather than unite an existing “political society.” That is also why they were not, the petition continued, “cosmopolitan”: “They belonged to nowhere in the universe,” rather than to everywhere.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1004" href="#calibre_link-374" class="calibre6">93</a>
</sup>
 Jewish asociality, in other words, was a direct extension of Jews’ religious infidelity, and usury was the confirmation of their proclivity to exploit Christian society. As patriotism became the foundation of the new political order, the trope of Jews’ multiple allegiances was used to render them unfit for citizenship and became a weapon in the hands of those opposing Jewish emancipation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1005" href="#calibre_link-375" class="calibre6">94</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">At the onset of the Revolution, Grégoire moved to Paris and abandoned apologetics in favor of political action, embracing radical positions in the National Constituent Assembly. In October 1789, his <em class="calibre4">Motion en faveur des Juifs</em>
 laid out the arguments for granting Jews full equality. Grégoire’s political <span title="150" id="calibre_link-1633"></span>
 activism was not aimed at Jews alone. In fact, he fought equally if not more fervently for the emancipation of African slaves in the French Caribbean. I will return to this point in the next section, but it needs to be noted here if we are to understand Grégoire’s statements about Jews as evidence of the possibilities of and constraints placed on minority groups’ participation in an egalitarian (Christian) society. Grégoire’s activism was conditional on Jews’ shedding what he regarded as moral, social, and religious liabilities that were incompatible with those of citizens. His view of usury as constitutive of Jewish character was one of the pillars of this conditional approach to emancipation.</p>
<p class="indent">In his <em class="calibre4">Essay</em>
 , Grégoire had borrowed from Dohm the claim that Jews brought banking to Bordeaux and Bayonne. But the contention, in light of Grégoire’s use of the legend, was not meant as a compliment.<sup class="calibre7">

 Perhaps impressed by his encounter with a delegation of Jews from southwestern France, in his <em class="calibre4">Motion</em>
 the revolutionary priest hailed the respectability of the Jews of Amsterdam, The Hague, Berlin, and Bordeaux, describing them more generously than he had in his <em class="calibre4">Essay</em>
 . In the <em class="calibre4">Motion</em>
 , however, Grégoire resorted once again to the legend as evidence of the interdependence of Jewish commerce and usury.<sup class="calibre7">

 More generally, throughout his work, he sometimes referred to “the Jews” collectively and sometimes contrasted the Sephardim and Ashkenazim, although ultimately he hoped for the conversion of all of them.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">How did Jews respond, rhetorically, to these indictments? Among the entrants in the Metz contest, Hourwitz alone came close to singling out the Sephardim as the living example of regeneration. But he too alternated between distinguishing Sephardic commerce from Ashkenazic moneylending and conflating the two. In both cases, he indicated that usury separated Jews from the rest of the population. To remedy the situation, Hourwitz advocated Jews’ admission to craft guilds and liberal professions and recommended that they be allowed to cultivate the land&mdash;all measures that would decrease the number of merchants among them “and thus the number of <em class="calibre4">fripons</em>
 .”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1009" href="#calibre_link-379" class="calibre6">98</a>
</sup>
 He urged Jews to take concrete steps to abandon all particularism, to develop closer ties to gentile customers, and to submit themselves to “the inspection of <em class="calibre4">la police</em>
 ” in order to diminish opportunities “to cheat and steal” and thus enhance the chances that merchants among them would turn “into more honest men.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1010" href="#calibre_link-380" class="calibre6">99</a>

 If they followed his recommendations, he concluded, the Jews of the eastern regions would “over time, become as happy and as useful to the state as their coreligionists from Bordeaux and Bayonne.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1011" href="#calibre_link-381" class="calibre6">100</a>
</sup>
 Nevertheless, Hourwitz’s depiction of Jewish economic activities displeased the leaders of Bordeaux’s Jewish <span title="151" id="calibre_link-1739"></span>
 community, who were offended by his essay’s call for regulation and likening of commerce to usury.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1012" href="#calibre_link-382" class="calibre6">101</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Other Jewish advocates also hinted at the utility of Jewish commerce or the beneficial effects that commerce had on the Sephardim of southwestern France, but unlike their seventeenth-century predecessors, they did not obtain new rights on the grounds that Jews’ skills in commerce and finance were useful to France. In 1788, the Sephardim petitioned Chrétien Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, the minister charged with reforming the status of non-Catholic French subjects, to be admitted to the chambers of commerce of the kingdom on account of what they “contribute[d] to the progress of commerce.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1013" href="#calibre_link-383" class="calibre6">102</a>
</sup>
 Their request was denied. There was a historical reason for this refusal. The stakes were different from those of 150 years earlier, when privileges&mdash;rather than rights&mdash;were the cardinal principles of politics. In the seventeenth century, Simone Luzzatto and Menasseh ben Israel could win their cases with Christian rulers by overstating Jews’ economic contributions. After the Revolution began, such arguments were no longer tenable. The deputies of the Jewish community of Bordeaux, addressing Grégoire in August 1789, cited “a multitude of associations devoted to trade and charity” as examples of the “fraternity between Christians and Jews” that entitled them to equal rights yet refrained from elaborating any further on their economic activities.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1014" href="#calibre_link-384" class="calibre6">103</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Jews’ advocacy of their rights at this time no longer revolved around claims of commercial utility. In January 1790, three representatives of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews of Bordeaux sent a letter to the National Constituent Assembly detailing how the Jews of the southwest differed from those of the rest of France and Europe at large. The letter argued that the Sephardim “were both <em class="calibre4">négociants</em>
 and farmers” and contributed to the flourishing of the region where they lived. But more than anything else, it stressed the civic equality that the Jews of southwestern France enjoyed with all other “co-citizens” thanks to the privileges granted to them by the crown in 1550 and again in 1776. It was on the basis of those privileges that they had been allowed to participate in the elections for the National Assembly. There was no difference, the representatives wrote, between the Jews of southwestern France and “French Catholics,” either in the “civil order” or in the “moral order.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1015" href="#calibre_link-385" class="calibre6">104</a>
</sup>
 The battle for citizenship was a political struggle fought on legal and moral grounds rather than economic ones.</p>
<p class="indent">Jewish authors from northeastern France used different slogans to advance their cause and put even less faith in the emancipatory effects of commerce. <span title="152" id="calibre_link-1634"></span>
 In a memo drafted to recruit Dohm to take on the cause of the Jews, the Strasbourg leader Cerf Berr touted freedom of commerce as an antidote to the causes of Jewish moneylending in Alsace. But he also exalted the economic functions of court Jews like himself, who served the economic needs of the state, more than he reaffirmed the tenets of <em class="calibre4">doux commerce</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1016" href="#calibre_link-386" class="calibre6">105</a>
</sup>
 In October 1789, Isaac Berr-Bing was even more cautious in demanding the lifting of all restrictions on Jewish occupations and property rights in Alsace and Lorraine. While celebrating the orderly society of the regions’ Jews, he lamented that petty trade (<em class="calibre4">la petite friperie</em>
 ) was the only occupation that sustained the two-thirds of the community who lived in poverty and stressed that no Jew in the area had ever engaged in wholesale trade in grain, “because our religion condemns those who amass this basic food staple.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1017" href="#calibre_link-387" class="calibre6">106</a>
</sup>
 The grain crisis of the summer prior had been the first major test of the revolutionary government, and Berr-Bing knew well the fears of oligopolies and famines that it had provoked. He chose to make the case for Judaism as a religion that inspired charity rather than emphasizing the virtues of large-scale commercial transactions handled by Jews.</p>
<p class="indent">Gentile observers were even more prone to conflate commerce with usury. In Alsace, an anonymous voice sympathetic to Jews praised their economic contributions to society and the state but equated “commerce” with “money-lending.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1018" href="#calibre_link-388" class="calibre6">107</a>
</sup>
 In a famous speech to the National Assembly on December 23, 1789, the Count of Clermont-Tonnerre said little of substance about the economic roles of Jews. He blamed the state’s restrictions on Jews’ professions, not their character, for their habit of lending at interest but lumped all moneyed professions together, without distinguishing between commerce and pawnbroking.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1019" href="#calibre_link-389" class="calibre6">108</a>
</sup>
 At the opposite end of the political spectrum, Abbé Maury denied that Jews had ever been an agricultural people (“They were laborers neither under King David nor under King Solomon”) and equated them with the Barbary pirates, who were “occupied solely in commerce” and lived off robbery at sea.<sup class="calibre7">

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2069">Jews and Other Minorities</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the revolutionary battle for equality, male Jews emerged as the winners while other disadvantaged groups were left behind. No single reason explains why Jewish men gained equality while women and blacks did not, although the temporary abolition of slavery (1794&ndash;1802) and Jews’ emancipation reveal the republican belief in the capacity of the Revolution to change the nature of <span title="153" id="calibre_link-1704"></span>
 men&mdash;although not women, who were never seen as real candidates for equality. Rather, the process of Jewish emancipation helps us better understand the limits of the Revolution’s universalism&mdash;limits derived not only from the perceived innate characteristics of each group that demanded inclusion in the new legal and political order but also from the need to reaffirm differences in this more egalitarian order. From both a historical and a theoretical perspective, women posed the greatest challenge to the universalism of human rights (not coincidentally called “the Rights of Man and of the Citizen” in the 1789 Declaration).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1035" href="#calibre_link-391" class="calibre6">124</a>

 A rare champion of women’s political equality, the Marquis of Condorcet was uncompromising in his defense of “natural rights” and the perfectibility of all humans. Yet he, too, had his favorite causes: he wrote more strenuously on behalf of slaves than Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1036" href="#calibre_link-392" class="calibre6">125</a>
</sup>
 Grégoire, by contrast, fought for active political rights for blacks and Jews but saw women as inherently unable to hold government and administrative positions.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1037" href="#calibre_link-393" class="calibre6">126</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">While he did not explicitly compare Jews and blacks, Grégoire relied on the same reasoning when he argued that both groups deserved inclusion in the body politic: as Christian persecutions hampered Jews, he noted, so “accidental circumstances and local causes have prevented or impeded the progress of civilization in Africa.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1038" href="#calibre_link-394" class="calibre6">127</a>
</sup>
 In this view, centuries of European exploitation rather than nature explained why free and enslaved blacks lingered in an inferior “degree of civilization”: “The natives of Africa and America would long ago have risen to the highest level of civilization if this good purpose would have been supported by a hundredth part of the efforts, the money, and the time that have been given over to tormenting and butchering many millions of these unfortunate people, whose blood calls for vengeance against Europe.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1039" href="#calibre_link-395" class="calibre6">128</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">For all the similarities of Grégoire’s arguments in favor of blacks and Jews, the <em class="calibre4">bon curé</em>
 patently considered it easier to “regenerate” the former than the latter. It has even been noted that during an animated session of the National Assembly in December 1789, Grégoire remained silent on the question of the fate of the Jews, perhaps for fear of endangering the antislavery cause.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1040" href="#calibre_link-396" class="calibre6">129</a>

 For sure he was generous in enumerating the “moral qualities of the negroes,” their “upright character” and “true bravery,” “their talents . . . for arts and craftsmanship,” and the sophistication of their “political societies” in Africa.<sup class="calibre7">

</sup>
 By contrast, one is hard pressed to find any praises of Jews’ cultural achievements in his Metz <em class="calibre4">Essay</em>
 . Rejecting Isaac de Pinto’s arguments, Grégoire was also skeptical of the existence of substantial differences between Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews and more inclined to think that “the Jewish nation has been the most like itself, at all times, both in beliefs and usages.” Surely, he claimed, <span title="154" id="calibre_link-1784"></span>
 “there is more resemblance between the Jews of Ethiopia and those of England, than between the inhabitants of Picardy and those of Provence.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1042" href="#calibre_link-398" class="calibre6">131</a>

 This was a low bar, which left no room for appreciating the Sephardim’s achievements in long-distance trade.</p>
<p class="indent">The lingering particularism that inflected revolutionary ideals is arguably the thorniest legacy that the events of the 1790s have bequeathed to Western liberalism, setting up a clash between an abstract aspiration to equality and the irreducible existence of differences, including the affirmation of those differences by legal and demographic minorities themselves.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1043" href="#calibre_link-399" class="calibre6">132</a>

 As Maurice Samuels has recently reminded us, the 1791 decree that emancipated all Jews in France included none of the conditions that theorists of “regeneration” had demanded, and yet, at times, their desire that Jews shed any residual particularism seems to have been fulfilled.<sup class="calibre7">

 In 1792, a Hebrew version of the <em class="calibre4">Marseillaise</em>

<a id="calibre_link-1045" href="#calibre_link-401" class="calibre6">134</a>

 In that same year, while battling militarily for survival, the French Republic included a recently emancipated Jewish citizen among its army suppliers.<sup class="calibre7">

</sup>
 But that compatibility was short-lived. Subsequent incarnations of French secularism (<em class="calibre4">laïcité</em>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2070">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">In his classic <em class="calibre4">The Passions and the Interests</em>
 , Hirschman departs from mainstream scholarship on Montesquieu to call attention to the contention that Jews invented bills of exchange. For his purposes, the validity and genealogy of that contention are irrelevant. Whether real or imaginary, the claim exemplifies Montesquieu’s argument that commercial expansion is incompatible with autocratic government. The legend is thus central to Hirschman’s overall thesis as captured by its subtitle: <em class="calibre4">Political Arguments for Capitalism Before Its Triumph</em>
 , with an emphasis on the word <em class="calibre4">Political</em>
 . Without denying the naïveté of some of Montesquieu’s generalizations, Hirschman finds that <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 planted the seeds for a fully developed theory of the interdependence of commerce and democracy that deserves as much attention as the paradigms proposed by Adam Smith and Karl Marx. Brilliant and penetrating, if inevitably <span title="155" id="calibre_link-1708"></span>
 partial, <em class="calibre4">The Passions and the Interests</em>
 has been hugely influential, to the point of obscuring how <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 was read at the time, certainly with regard to the assertion that Jews invented bills of exchange. In fact, commerce played a minor role, if any at all, in the political emancipation of Jews.</p>
<p class="indent">Montesquieu set up a dichotomy between bills of exchange as new and fundamentally positive credit devices and usury as a medieval and nefarious credit practice. Historians of eighteenth-century French Jews have mapped this dichotomy onto the Sephardim/Ashkenazim divide and emphasized the divergent socioeconomic profiles of the Jewish communities in the southwestern and northeastern regions of the kingdom. The Sephardim engaged in long-distance trade and international finance and were better integrated into the fabric of local society, while the Ashkenazim, who were overwhelmingly occupied in moneylending and petty trade, experienced social isolation and were the targets of overt Christian hostility.</p>
<p class="indent">In the accepted account of emancipation, articulated in both academic and popular histories of the Jews, this divide had direct political consequences because commerce made the Sephardim of Bordeaux into more respectable members of the wider community, paving the way for citizenship. In the early twentieth century, the author of a brief outline of the history of Jewish emancipation in France could write: “I dwell somewhat upon the Bordeaux Jews, for . . . it was their position more than any other single fact or argument whatsoever which carried the Jews of France past the crisis of their faith.” Although a few pages later he describes the debates in the National Assembly as “a chaos of ideas and motives,” the same author celebrates the Sephardim as pathbreakers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1021" href="#calibre_link-404" class="calibre6">110</a>
</sup>
 More recent scholarship refines but does not alter this picture and even suggests that the Sephardim of Bordeaux sought to distance themselves from their Ashkenazic brethren in 1789&ndash;1790 (and perhaps even to stall the latter’s emancipation) for fear of compromising their own chances.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1022" href="#calibre_link-405" class="calibre6">111</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This widely shared view of emancipation implies the existence of an invisible link connecting Montesquieu’s celebration of Jewish commercial activity, captured by his positive spin on the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, to the extension of citizenship to the Sephardim in January 1790, granted eighteen months before the same rights were conferred on all Jewish men of France. One scholar, making that link explicit, even wonders why Montesquieu fell short of advocating full equality for Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1023" href="#calibre_link-406" class="calibre6">112</a>
</sup>
 The analysis I have provided thus far demonstrates that the question is misguided.</p>
<p class="indent">My case rests on my reading of the French Enlightenment, variegated as the phenomena that fall under this rubric are. Schechter has already demonstrated <span title="156" id="calibre_link-1642"></span>
 that interest in Jews in eighteenth-century French thought far exceeded what their numbers might logically call for, with images of Jews serving as vehicles to articulate concepts that had little or nothing to do with Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1024" href="#calibre_link-407" class="calibre6">113</a>
</sup>
 However, neither he nor any of the numerous scholars who have written about eighteenth-century French commerce broadly conceived have paid much attention to the historical and figurative presence of Jews in that realm. Given the centrality of <em class="calibre4">doux commerce</em>
 in French economic and political thought, it is important to highlight the role that Montesquieu attributed to Jews in the development of the spirit of commerce, as well as the “moderate” political implications of his account.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1025" href="#calibre_link-408" class="calibre6">114</a>
</sup>
 He never argued explicitly in favor of a nonconfessional commercial society and believed that merchants should operate within the confines of a corporatist framework that constrained any potentially disruptive effects on existing hierarchies. Montesquieu’s unshakable belief in a society of orders allowed him to celebrate Jewish commerce in ways in which more egalitarian thinkers would not.</p>
<p class="indent">His novel interpretation of the legend presupposed a discontinuity between medieval usury and early modern forms of credit but was far from a cry for equality. By the mid-eighteenth century, it had become a cliché for theorists of commercial society to maintain, as Forbonnais did, that commerce bound people into “reciprocal communication.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1026" href="#calibre_link-409" class="calibre6">115</a>
</sup>
 This communication was understood as compatible with the existence of inherent differences and hierarchies. In the 1760s, both the <em class="calibre4">Encyclopédie</em>
 and the Jewish authors who rebutted Voltaire’s anti-Jewish writings could celebrate Jewish merchants as “pegs and nails” in the edifice of global trade as well as emphasize the status of the Jews of Bordeaux and Bayonne as subjects of the crown (<em class="calibre4">régnicoles</em>
 ) rather than foreigners. In 1765, when Jacob Rodrigues Péreire (1715&ndash;1780), a leader of the then official Sephardic community, republished the <em class="calibre4">lettres patentes</em>
 that had granted the “Portuguese merchants” of Bordeaux their privileges from 1550 to 1723, he extolled these individuals’ “talent in making commerce flourish and their genius at creating new trade branches.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1027" href="#calibre_link-410" class="calibre6">116</a>
</sup>
 But emancipation was not even on the horizon in those years. In the most consistent defense of Jews’ contributions to commerce in the 1760s, the Parisian Jew Israël Bernard de Vallabrègue used the generic meaning of the word “citizen” in his argument for Jewish civic equality, without making any reference to active political rights.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1028" href="#calibre_link-411" class="calibre6">117</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Commerce, in other words, was undoubtedly the linchpin of early modern toleration policies that offered New Christians and New Jews in southwestern France privileges that their brethren in Alsace and Lorraine could not aspire <span title="157" id="calibre_link-1709"></span>
 to attain. Commerce also embedded Jewish and Christian merchants in networks of economic dependence (often connected via bills of exchange), both in Bordeaux and overseas. These privileges, and the social interactions they generated, however, were only acceptable in a society in which the majority population was clearly separated from Jews and the latter could not aspire to full membership in it. When equality became a possibility, few heralded the Jews of southwestern France as archetypes of the virtues of commercial credit in contrast to the Jews of northeastern France, who remained emblems of usury.</p>
<p class="indent">No matter how diverse they may be, all the texts examined here dating to the last quarter of the eighteenth century failed to differentiate between commerce and usury. <em class="calibre4">Friponnerie</em>
 was viewed as the hallmark of both. Usury and bad faith were understood to be the antisocial faces of commerce, and, in the eyes of even the most sympathetic observers, they remained historically (if not theologically) associated with Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1029" href="#calibre_link-412" class="calibre6">118</a>
</sup>
 The frequent blurring of the boundaries between commerce and usury in eighteenth-century French representations of Jewish economic roles not only proves the tenacity of discursive traditions, sometimes even when authors consciously tried to break with those traditions, but also demonstrates that the exaltation of Jews’ commercial prowess was a more effective rhetorical strategy in the context of Old Regime policies of toleration than it was during the struggle for emancipation. The lexical and conceptual slippage between commerce and usury that is detectable from Lacretelle onward signals the tenuousness of the line separating Ashkenazic moneylending from Sephardic commerce in the Christian imagination. That the Revolution emancipated the Jews of France in two steps, those of the southwest in January 1790 and all others in September 1791, arguably suggests that the Sephardim were regarded as more acculturated. But the 1790 decree, in line with the demands of Sephardic leaders, who clung to the hope of preserving their corporate autonomy, portrayed emancipation as the confirmation of preexisting privileges. When such language expressing continuity with the Old Regime disappeared from the 1791 decree, it was not&mdash;<em class="calibre4">pace</em>
 Hirschman&mdash;because commercial “interests” had displaced prevailing “passions” about Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1030" href="#calibre_link-413" class="calibre6">119</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Amid the “cacophony of arguments” marshaled in favor of emancipation, the virtues of commerce were never used as weapons by pro-Jewish advocates.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1031" href="#calibre_link-414" class="calibre6">120</a>
</sup>
 Only the little crossover that exists between French and Jewish historiographies and the scant attention that both pay to the language used by <span title="158" id="calibre_link-1741"></span>
 the champions of Jewish rights to describe Jews’ economic roles can explain why many scholars still regard Sephardic merchants as the driving force in the emancipation process. Perhaps nowhere is the disconnect between scholarship on Jewish emancipation and scholarship on the Revolution more pronounced than in the treatment of Honoré-Gabriel de Riqueti, Count of Mirabeau (1749&ndash;1791), son of the noted physiocrat and the most influential politician of the first year of the National Assembly (1789&ndash;1790). Historians of European Jewry know him for his laudatory portrait of Moses Mendelssohn and his support of Jewish rights in a pamphlet that was modeled largely on Dohm’s ideas.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1032" href="#calibre_link-415" class="calibre6">121</a>
</sup>
 Historians of the Revolution know him as a master orator, the fierce and opportunistic adversary of Finance Minister Jacques Necker, and the writer of a “climactic pamphlet,” <em class="calibre4">Dénonciation de l’agiotage</em>
 (<em class="calibre4">Denunciation of Speculation</em>
 ), which belonged to a series that, while serving the interests of a circle of bankers and friends who gambled in stocks and foreign currencies, condemned the crown’s handling of the public debt and financial markets.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1033" href="#calibre_link-416" class="calibre6">122</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, the two Mirabeaus have a lot in common. Both of his influential pamphlets, the one on Jews and the one on speculation, were written in 1787 when Mirabeau was in Berlin, where Mendelssohn had lived until his death the year before. Both conveyed the same message, one resonant of physiocratic principles, which favored economic liberalization, including the abolition of guilds and other corporate institutions that had long restricted Jews’ economic activities, but deplored commerce and banking. In this formulation, in order to become citizens and patriots, Jews had to recover the supposedly rural way of life of the ancient Israelites and sever their long-held ties to commerce, which Mirabeau called “the veritable, or rather the only cause of the corruption of the Jews.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1034" href="#calibre_link-417" class="calibre6">123</a>
</sup>
 Montesquieu had denounced John Law but did not see private credit as existing on a continuum with public finance. On the eve of the Revolution, however, the awareness of how easily private speculators could alter the value of the royal treasury made it more difficult to sustain the difference between private and public finance.</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, the economic dimension of Jewish emancipation exposes the limits of French universalism. In the aftermath of the Revolution, the poor economic condition of the majority of French Jews and entrenched suspicions about their usurious character had a decisive effect on the stalling of the advancement of formal equality. Responding to the popular hostility unleashed by the emancipation decrees and persistent complaints that Jews in the northeastern regions “followed no other profession than that of usurers,” in 1806 <span title="159" id="calibre_link-1646"></span>
 Napoleon convened the Assembly of Jewish Notables, later constituted as the Grand Sanhedrin, to address problems raised by the imperfect assimilation of Jews. In the meantime, he suspended repayments of all loans made by Jews to “husbandmen, not traders,” for a year’s time.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1048" href="#calibre_link-418" class="calibre6">137</a>
</sup>
 Usury, alongside marriage, divorce, rabbinical authority, and military service, figured prominently among the controversial questions that Jews were asked to answer as evidence of their willingness to assimilate.</p>
<p class="indent">With the cooperation of the Assembly’s head, Abraham Furtado, who was, conveniently, a leading Sephardi from Bordeaux and a former Girondin, Napoleon secured assent to what came to be known among French Jews as the “infamous decree.” Promulgated on March 17, 1808, it ruled invalid all loans made by Jews with interest rates above 10 percent a year or issued to minors, women, and soldiers. The state imposed further restrictions on Jews who wished to engage in commerce: they had to obtain a special license, which required a review of their character and verification that they had not previously engaged in usurious activities. These measures, together with other limitations on Jews’ civil rights, applied only to the Jews of Alsace and Lorraine, were set to last for ten years, and aimed to alter not only the socioeconomic profile but also the inner character of the newly emancipated group. The Jews of southwestern France were spared these humiliating restrictions but were also much fewer in number than their Ashkenazic brethren and did not loom as large in the French imagination.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, usury was the symbol of something bigger&mdash;namely, the suspicion that Jews might be unable to partake in civil and political society as fair players. Forced into (or assumed to occupy) an economic position from which they could take advantage of everyone else, Jews were regarded by most as unable to meet the demands of equality. The transformation of their legal status that occurred during the Revolution was enormous, but representations of Jews after emancipation continued to be predicated on a centuries-long discursive tradition. In the late Middle Ages, economic and religious infidelity were cited as reasons for excluding Jews not only from the urban patriciate that ruled commercially minded city-states, but also from the ideology of the common good more generally. In the newborn French nation-state, Jews’ usurious character was perceived as deriving from a lack of patriotism.</p>
<p class="indent">The transition from a medieval to a modern conception of political belonging was gradual&mdash;and accompanied by changes in the meaning of the word “nation”&mdash;but it did not dispense with persistent fears of economic oligopolies and conspiracies. Among the reasons given by the six guilds of Paris <span title="160" id="calibre_link-1841"></span>
 for rejecting the membership of Jewish merchants in 1767, one turned to an alchemical metaphor: Jews were like particles of quicksilver, which run in all directions but ultimately always unite in one single block. Whereas French Catholic merchant houses operated as individual units in fair competition with one another, every single Jew, the Parisian merchants claimed, was inseparable from his larger “nation,” and therefore each one could destabilize “the harmony of political societies.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1049" href="#calibre_link-419" class="calibre6">138</a>

 The same logic was articulated in new language after the Revolution. In 1810, even Grégoire accused the Jews of dis-loyalty to France: “The Jew has his eyes constantly turned toward Jerusalem, desiring only it for his <em class="calibre4">patrie</em>
 [motherland].”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1050" href="#calibre_link-420" class="calibre6">139</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">By following the winding paths of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange across eighteenth-century France, I have revisited key moments in the history of the Enlightenment and the Revolution. In contrast to the tendency of most histories of economic thought to slice up the eighteenth century into discrete, if sometimes temporally overlapping, doctrines, ranging from the anticommercial stand of Fénelon’s classical republicanism to the physiocrats’ call for the liberalization of trade and manufacture and for the primacy of agriculture over public and private credit, I have stressed the extent to which the legend traversed such partitions. Its malleability allowed it to serve multiple purposes. Montesquieu appropriated it in order to develop a critique of despotism and religious intolerance that hinged on an exaggerated image of Jewish commercial ingenuity. Later in the century, Grégoire evoked it to reinforce a historical connection between Jews and rapacious moneylending that at times veered toward essentialism.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not a coincidence that Montesquieu wrote in Bordeaux and Grégoire in Lorraine, but the trajectory of the legend that identified Jews as the originators of modern European financial instruments suggests something deeper. The revolutionary promise of equality carried with it the prospect of a fully realized society of contract, in which credit markets would shed their religious and corporatist biases in favor of anonymous competition. Equality and anonymity in turn carried with them new risks: How could one discern which economic actors were reputable and which duplicitous in an impersonal market? As emancipation promised to eliminate every last vestige of formal discrimination against Jewish economic actors, Cleirac’s concerns from a century and a half earlier about the inability to detect fraud in the new paper economy regained purchase. At the dawn of the democratic age, emancipation was an indisputable achievement, yet the backlashes it generated echoed older responses. <span title="161" id="calibre_link-1843"></span>
 Christian abhorrence for crypto-Judaism resurfaced in new guises. The demand for one form of regeneration, the economic, replaced the original religious concept of spiritual rebirth. Even more important, citizenship replaced baptism as the requisite rite of passage but remained equally unpersuasive in dispelling Christian mistrust of the newly emancipated Jews. Equality at once expanded the boundaries of commercial society and rendered Jews more and more indistinguishable from all other citizens. Once again, Jews’ invisibility intensified fears of contamination, and their perceived ubiquity continued to serve as a metaphor for the perils lurking behind ever more complex financial markets.</p>

<span class="small1">THE REWORKING OF THE</span>
 legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange by Montesquieu proved the most influential reinterpretation of Étienne Cleirac’s 1647 narrative and injected new life into the tale. The fact that the same narrative of Jewish ingenuity could radiate diverse, even contradictory, meanings is one of the reasons why it traveled so far and retained its power for so long. In the pages that follow, I analyze the legend’s echoes beyond France up to 1800 and how they intersected with a variety of discourses about the morality of commercial credit. For the sake of clarity, the chapter is organized by politico-linguistic regions, although intellectuals and state administrators in eighteenth-century Europe borrowed ideas from one another and crossed borders more easily than they would after the advent of the nation-state. I organize the traces left by the legend across Europe by the regions in which it appeared in print in order of frequency: England/Britain, the Holy Roman Empire, the Italian and Iberian peninsulas, and the United Provinces.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1052" href="#calibre_link-1365" class="calibre6">1</a>
</sup>
 A final section examines the first published appropriation of the legend by an Anglo-Jewish author.</p>
<p class="indent">By using the legend as my Ariadne’s thread across the Continent and beyond the Channel, my purpose is neither to compile an exhaustive list of all authors who discussed the idea that Jews invented marine insurance or bills of exchange nor to force those authors into preestablished schools of thought. Rather, I wish to tackle the three broad issues that I outlined in the introduction: the definition of a canon, the relationship between images and practices, and the continuities and changes in Christian representations of Jewish commerce. Along which routes did the tale of the Jewish invention of Europe’s financial instruments travel beyond France, and how did it acquire local purchase? And what does the legend tell us about the persistence of discursive <span title="163" id="calibre_link-1876"></span>
 traditions that associated Jews and money and the ways in which those traditions intersected with or skirted specific polemics about the status of commerce in the social and political order? As we progress into the eighteenth century, we also need to address an additional topic: changing scholarly procedures of verification. Did the least plausible aspects of the legend set in motion the process of formulating new standards of proof, or did they remain impermeable to them?</p>
<p class="indent">As noted before, statistics are not adequate tools with which to answer these questions. Even if we wanted to verify the incidence of the legend in quantitative terms, a comprehensive bibliography of all European books only exists for the period before 1600, rendering it nearly impossible to calculate the frequency of words, passages, or even titles in the material printed during the two centuries that followed.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1053" href="#calibre_link-1366" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
 Nor does a capacious and clearly demarcated corpus exist against which to measure the legend’s recurrence within all works dealing with the economy writ large.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1054" href="#calibre_link-1367" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
 The higher incidence of references to the alleged Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange that can be seen in English works might be related to the output of English-language printed media, which we can reasonably assume to have been higher than that of Portugal, for example, or to the likely overrepresentation of English-language material in the rare book collections currently available online. Only further expansion of these collections will permit us to test some of the arguments I present in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">One point is indisputable: it would be misleading to focus only on canonical works. Savary and Montesquieu were exceptional amplifiers of the legend, but genres during this period were by definition blurred, and now-forgotten texts such as Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 continued to be read widely. During the eighteenth century, accounts of the origins of bills of exchange and marine insurance figured in an increasingly wide spectrum of works, ranging from merchant handbooks to treatises like <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 , encyclopedias, legal commentaries, novels, and more.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1055" href="#calibre_link-1368" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
 Moreover, it was primarily in lesser-known publications that the legend’s credibility was scrutinized and challenged. And because even works that sought to debunk the legend indirectly propagated it, appendix 6 lists all printed works that mentioned the legend regardless of whether they endorsed it or not. Appendix 6, however, cannot do justice to the myriad ways in which the legend was rewritten or the varied discursive contexts in which it was embedded. That is the task of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">As I have done with regard to France, I scan the broader environment of the legend’s reception. Multiple factors affected its dissemination, standing, <span title="164" id="calibre_link-1844"></span>
 and reworking, including authorial credibility, the effects of serial publication and intertextual transmission, the local politics of commerce and finance, and reform projects aiming to improve the conditions of Jewish life. Given the vastness of the terrain I cover, my analysis is more cursory than it has been in the previous chapters. It nonetheless yields several important findings that challenge received wisdom about how both real and imaginary Jews figured in the making of European commercial society.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the legend that pointed to Jews as the creators of European private finance did not travel along confessional lines. Developed in Catholic France, the legend also appeared in England, the Reformed areas of the Holy Roman Empire, and the United Provinces. The Catholic&ndash;Protestant divide, to which scholars of Western capitalism have attributed great significance, turns out not to be a pertinent axis along which to organize our inquiry. Second, although they were shaped by an arsenal of Christian representations of Jews that traversed periods and cultures, public debates about Jews’ economic credibility were more intense where cultural acceptance of the merchant profession and the place of commerce and finance in national politics was most contentious. This explains why we detect the lowest incidence of the legend in both the most and the least tolerant areas of Europe: the United Provinces and the Iberian peninsula, respectively. These were also the two regions where commerce enjoyed the highest and the lowest levels of legal and cultural recognition. As in France, then, elsewhere in Europe the legend conveyed the most elusive critiques of the evils of credit in those contexts where the expansion of credit was underway. Third, we cannot establish a simple correlation between the degree of a society’s commercialization and positive images of Jews. In England and the United Provinces, the emergence of the stock market (rather than bills of exchange) was the catalyst for an increase in hostile views toward Jews, who symbolized the dangers brought by financial speculation. It is thus not surprising that arguments about Jewish commercial prowess did not advance the cause of Jewish emancipation in these countries.</p>
<p class="indent">A lag of more than fifty years separates the legend’s appearance in French and its circulation in other languages, in part because of the time it took for the translation of Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 to permeate the foreign commercial literature. Translations of works by the Savary family and Montesquieu were the legend’s most influential vehicles of diffusion and transmutation. Most non-French versions of the legend, however, adapted the tale to make it palatable to new readerships. Montesquieu’s status certainly contributed to the legend’s credibility in the eighteenth century. At the same time, an increasing <span title="165" id="calibre_link-1766"></span>
 number of writers challenged the legend’s accuracy. They did so from an array of perspectives. Some simply picked up on earlier doubts about its logic. More deployed new evidentiary tools, including source criticism, to dispute the legend’s historical veracity and debunk its assertions. Others continued to believe that particular merchant communities were responsible for world-changing innovations but disputed the idea that the invention of marine insurance or bills of exchange should be attributed specifically to Jews.</p>
<p class="indent">The legend’s reception thus provides a lens through which to analyze the impact of changing scholarly practices in the age of colossal encyclopedic projects, world histories of commerce, and renewed interest in studying Roman law. It also demonstrates how, as it traveled to different parts of Europe during the eighteenth century, the legend was absorbed into emerging proto-nationalist discourses. Many Italian authors insisted that Florentines rather than Jews had been the first to devise bills of exchange and to propel Europe’s commercial expansion, just as the glorious voyages undertaken by famous explorers and pathfinders had. Certain English and German authors also argued for alternative historical trajectories, although they could not attribute the invention to their ancestors as easily. In Germany during the latter part of the eighteenth century, the reworking of the legend even stimulated the emergence of a new and influential narrative about the economic function of Jews. According to this narrative, Christian resentment of Jews’ alleged domination of commerce spurred Europe’s late medieval economic growth by encouraging Christian merchants to take control of the financial innovations that Jews had presumably devised and, until then, monopolized. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, this narrative had become a pillar of some of the most influential academic accounts of European economic history (<a href="#calibre_link-846" class="calibre6">chapter 8</a>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">For all of these reasons, the reception of the legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange anticipates some and even constitutes one of the most important developments in European economic thought up through the nineteenth century. Though my focus is necessarily on Christian images of Jews, I also discuss a few Jewish authors at the end of the chapter in order to assess their reaction to Christian presumptions about Jews’ ostensible commercial dexterity. One author in particular, Isaac D’Israeli (1766&ndash;1848), stands out not only because he was the first Jewish writer to mention the legend in print but also because, borrowing from Montesquieu, he endorsed it emphatically. How to explain D’Israeli? Admittedly, few Jewish authors wrote in vernacular about economic matters during the early modern period. But a body of Jewish apologetic writings did stress Jews’ economic <span title="166" id="calibre_link-1849"></span>
 talents (to the point of exaggeration) in order to secure more favorable treatment from Christian rulers interested in expanding their commercial reach (<a href="#calibre_link-298" class="calibre6">chapter 5</a>
 ). Had the legend primarily carried the positive meaning that Montesquieu attributed to it, Jewish authors, I suspect, would have evoked it in their pleas to secular authorities. Yet they did not. As we examine the first, hesitant introduction of the legend to Jewish self-representations at the end of the eighteenth century, we also need to interrogate this silence.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2071">England/Britain</h3>
<p class="noindent">If we exclude the translations of Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 into German (1676) and Dutch (1683), to which I will return, England (Great Britain after 1707) is the European country outside of France where we find the earliest mentions of the legend of the medieval Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange. There, the legend joined a variety of allegorical mentions of Jews that functioned as vehicles of expression for anxieties about the morality of private and public credit.</p>
<p class="indent">If credit permeated all strata of English society even more than in France, the institutions that promoted and regulated it were considerably different from their French counterparts. Lower courts offered cheap remedies to litigants seeking to settle small debts. At the opposite end of the credit market, after 1613, the East India Company used equity rather than debt to finance its operations, issuing shares of its stock and paying dividends periodically. During the second half of the seventeenth century, a private and public securities market flourished, and the financial revolution of 1688&ndash;1694 joined the interests of the state and individual investors as never before in European history. In London, the number of individuals who owned and traded companies’ shares increased fivefold between the 1690s and the 1720s.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1056" href="#calibre_link-1369" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
 The legal and cultural barriers to the nobility’s involvement in commerce and finance were considerably lower in England than in France. The status of Jews in these countries was also remarkably different. After the 1656 tacit readmission, the Jewish community in England evolved from a tiny Iberian New Christian presence to a growing and economically polarized group. As a result of these intersecting trends, in eighteenth-century England “Jewishness” assumed connotations that were not present in France, including the association of Jews with the stock market rather than with bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1057" href="#calibre_link-1370" class="calibre6">6</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Post-Reformation England regulated usury in ways not dissimilar from those found in Catholic France: in 1571 annual interest rates of up to 10 percent <span title="167" id="calibre_link-1703"></span>
 were permitted on mortgages, a ceiling that by the early eighteenth century had declined to 5 percent.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1058" href="#calibre_link-1371" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
 Meanwhile, the rampant need for credit during the sixteenth-century economic boom coincided with a shortage of minted coins. This situation was sometimes blamed on bills of exchange, which unsettled the balance of trade. In the short term, preoccupations about rapacious moneylending intensified. The discursive equation of usurers and Jews that we have examined at length was very much alive in Tudor and Stuart England. Francis Bacon opened his “Of Usury” (1625) by drawing on a trope we have encountered many times: “Usurers should have orange-tawney bonnets, because they do judaize.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1059" href="#calibre_link-1372" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
 As it had centuries earlier, the verb “to Judaize” singled out those who were construed as imitating Jews, rather than Jews themselves, and who therefore needed to wear a distinctive sign marking them apart from fair economic actors. Thomas Wilson’s <em class="calibre4">A Discourse upon Usury</em>
 (1572), a widely reprinted fictional dialogue about the merits and dangers of moneylending and credit, had relied on the same discursive equation of usurers and Jews. Wilson’s text, punctuated by religious sermons, was made up of opinionated exchanges between a merchant, two lawyers, and a preacher. In it, the latter (an “enemy to usurie”) rails against Jews’ penchant for usury in language reminiscent of Matthew Paris: all those Englishmen who “lende their money or their goods whatsoever for gain, I take them to be no better than Iewes.” One lawyer agrees with the preacher on this point: “No better do I call them [i.e., merchants] then Iewes, yea, worse than any infidel, that wittingly lvye by the onely gayne of their money.”<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">After Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell quietly agreed to allow the practice of Judaism in London in 1656, Jews became a lived reality in England for the first time since the royal expulsion of 1290. The size of the Jewish community remained relatively small until the mid-eighteenth century, when refugees from central and eastern Europe arrived in large numbers and tested the cohesion of Anglo Jewry as well as its collective image. In England, the divide between Sephardim and Ashkenazim was no less pronounced than in France, but unlike in France, it did not correspond to an equivalent degree of geographical segregation. Most Jews lived in London. Sephardim counted among themselves few wealthy traders, financiers, and army suppliers, but those who reached that level of economic success were highly visible. Most Ashkenazic Jews, by contrast, were poor, sometimes extremely so, and regarded as petty criminals. Evidence from the historical insurance market gives us a measure of their bad repute. In 1786, after a fire destroyed the house of some people referred to as “the lower Order of Jews,” the surveyors reported back to the <span title="168" id="calibre_link-1705"></span>
 underwriters that “from every appearance of the persons and inhabitations of many of the claimants, they had the greatest reason to suspect their accounts to be false and fraudulent.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1061" href="#calibre_link-1374" class="calibre6">10</a>
</sup>
 The insinuation was that members of “the lower Order of Jews” had likely set fire to the house themselves in order to cash in on the rewards. We have no way of determining whether the allegation was true. The point is rather that the lack of credibility associated with Jews (or at least Ashkenazim) not only served as an ethical yardstick against which to judge everyone’s behavior but could also have a tangible effect on Jews’ daily lives.</p>
<p class="indent">For all the enthusiasm that surrounded the rapid commercialization of seventeenth-and eighteenth-century England, an equally profound awareness existed that, as Julian Hoppit puts it, “credit had negative as well as positive features,” and not all of those features were easily measurable.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1062" href="#calibre_link-1375" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
 Concerns about the potentially destructive consequences of reckless speculation, the moral corruption generated by excessive spending, and the devious motives of those who pumped cash into the pockets of needy borrowers accompanied the expansion of private, public, and corporate credit.</p>
<p class="indent">Literary scholars have detected a pronounced gender bias in the language with which these concerns were expressed, exemplified by Daniel Defoe’s “Lady Credit,” who personified the flimsy, irrational, and improper character of Britain’s booming financial speculation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1063" href="#calibre_link-1376" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
 However, these scholars have rarely looked at literary figures of Jews alongside those of women in English representations of credit. In London and other cities, credit and its discontents were the talk of the town. Surveying the polemical and practical literature on credit between 1680 and the 1790s, Hoppit corrects the progressive perspective that places Adam Smith at the apex of a long-term transformation of English (later British) social and economic thought and concludes that most ordinary commentaries on credit throughout the period were informed “by ideas that were more often backward than forward looking.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1064" href="#calibre_link-1377" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
 Among these backward-looking ideas he notes the association of Jews with pawnbroking, an association that inflated Jewish involvement in that activity at the time but served as a criticism of financial extortion conducted by well-known political figures.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1065" href="#calibre_link-1378" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Legislation to regulate financial markets, and stockbrokers in particular, was proposed numerous times during the eighteenth century but dismissed in the interest of protecting the fiscal needs of the state.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1066" href="#calibre_link-1379" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 This legislative vacuum opened the door for symbolic regulatory tools: out-groups such as Huguenots, Jews, and the Dutch, who populated but did not dominate the London financial market, were constructed as personifications of oligopoly and deceit. <span title="169" id="calibre_link-1664"></span>
 Trapped in a half-real and half-imaginary medieval past, the figure of the Jewish usurer continued to exert considerable influence in early modern England, as it did in France. Invoking this figure allowed one to draw the moral line between merchants contributing to the common good and those seeking to enrich themselves at all costs.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, a new theme marked the conversion of the Jewish pawnbroker into the Jewish financier in England: the association of the latter with trading in stocks rather than in bills of exchange. Amid the thousands of pages Defoe wrote on commerce, he spoke sparingly of Jews, but when he did, it was primarily to denounce them as the epitome of unrestrained speculation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1067" href="#calibre_link-1380" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
 His depiction of Exchange Alley, the area of narrow streets and coffeehouses where brokers who had been expelled from the Royal Exchange traded in stocks, centered on the repellent character of Jewish dealers: “The Alley throngs with Jews, Jobbers and Brokers, their names are needless, their Characters dirty as their employment, and the best thing that I can yet find out to say of them, is, that there happens to be two honest Men among them.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1068" href="#calibre_link-1381" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The collapse of the speculative frenzy known as the South Sea Bubble in 1720 brought to the surface thinly veiled resentments against Jews, which, as we will see, had already emerged in the United Provinces after the Amsterdam stock market took a sudden plunge in 1688.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1069" href="#calibre_link-1382" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
 In times of exuberant speculation, exaltation of the virtues of commerce often gave way to conservative critiques: opportunists tricked naïve investors, gambled on the fictional value of paper instruments, and endangered the well-being of the country for the sole purpose of advancing their station. Theatrical representations satirized the promise of social mobility that credit offered and often resorted to Jewish characters to do so.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1070" href="#calibre_link-1383" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
 Many of these critiques had clear political connotations. As Jonathan Karp has noted, the Tory Party&mdash;the defender of landed interests and values&mdash;turned the figure of the Jewish “stockjobber” (a term heavily used in the public sphere after 1720) into a weapon of propaganda against Whig campaigns in favor of expanding overseas trade and the power of the Bank of England.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1071" href="#calibre_link-1384" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Lord Bolingbroke and his Tory supporters were the most vocal but not the only detractors of the paper economy. David Hume, like Montesquieu, famously despised the public debt more than private credit.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1072" href="#calibre_link-1385" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
 Adam Smith, who had witnessed the effects of the Panic of 1772 in Scotland, described in detail the advantages of banknotes and bills of exchange but also warned about the risks brought by the “excessive circulation of paper money,” that is, the imbalance between banknotes and bills of exchange in circulation and a country’s <span title="170" id="calibre_link-1629"></span>
 bullion reserves. In condemning such excesses, Smith invoked Greek mythology rather than anti-Jewish clichés, contrasting “the Dædalian wings of paper money” with “the solid ground of gold and silver.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1073" href="#calibre_link-1386" class="calibre6">22</a>
</sup>
 Those who espoused the anticommercial ethos of classical republicanism were more likely to borrow from the stockpile of anti-Jewish rhetoric. Writing from London in 1786, John Adams urged Thomas Jefferson to strengthen Congress’ control over public finance. His outsized fear that European speculators might bring the United States to its knees found expression in terms that we have come to recognize: “Jews and Judaizing Christians are now scheming to buy up all our continental notes at two or three shillings in the pound, in order to oblige us to pay them at twenty shillings. This will be richer plunder than that of Algerines, or Lloyd’s coffee houses.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1074" href="#calibre_link-1387" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
 Here, as in other instances, the boundaries between private and public credit were blurred.</p>
<p class="indent">In England as in France, metaphorical invocations of Jews not only greatly exaggerated Jews’ economic roles but also obscured real differences within Jewish society, and especially the gulf that separated affluent from impoverished Jews. The “Jew” in these narratives was either a treacherous money-lender or a masterful bond manipulator, both of which were seen as varieties of usurers. It was arguably with these images in mind that readers made sense of the references to the medieval Jewish invention of bills of exchange they encountered in English-language texts. Elizabethan literature, in which usury loomed large, did not attribute the invention of marine insurance or bills of exchange to Jews. Nor was the Jewish origin of these instruments mentioned in the earliest English treatises devoted solely to bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1075" href="#calibre_link-1388" class="calibre6">24</a>

 Rather, more or less literal translations of the Savarys and Montesquieu were the primary sources of the tale across the Channel.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1077" href="#calibre_link-1389" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
 The authority of these French texts and the ways in which translators adapted them thus proved decisive in shaping the legend’s reception. The writing of early modern merchant manuals and related works was not unlike that of encyclopedias: it relied on educated plagiarism. Some English merchant manuals translated Savary’s chapter on the origins of bills of exchange faithfully.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1078" href="#calibre_link-1390" class="calibre6">26</a>

<p class="indent">The delayed blossoming of English dictionaries of trade made them less susceptible to tales of origins. By the mid-eighteenth century, the evolution of European commercial society from a barter system to one based on money and finally paper credit instruments such as bills of exchange was an accepted narrative, even if exactly how the latter had come into being remained the <span title="171" id="calibre_link-1736"></span>

 , one of the most frequently reprinted English merchant manuals of the period, was agnostic about whether marine insurance had been invented by Roman emperor Claudius (as per Suetonius) or by French Jews in 1182 (as the Savarys claimed) but was certain that it had been brought into England “by some Italians from Lombardy, who at the same time came to settle at Antwerp” (the standard assumption to this day).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1081" href="#calibre_link-1392" class="calibre6">29</a>

 With regard to bills of exchange, Beawes was equally torn, debating whether they had been invented by Jews banished from France under Philip Augustus and Philip the Tall or, “with a greater appearance of probability,” by the Florentine Ghibellines who sought refuge in Lyon.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">The most authoritative and original engagement with the legend by a British author came from the pen of the prominent judge and jurist Sir William Blackstone (1723&ndash;1780). In his <em class="calibre4">Commentaries on the Laws of England</em>
 , he accepted the gist of the tale (that persecution had led to invention) but claimed a role for the English crown. The invention of bills of exchange, Blackstone wrote, occurred when Jews were “banished out of Guienne in 1297, and out of England in 1290.” At the time of the supposed events, the duchy of Guyenne was an English possession. By juxtaposing the two regions and the two dates, Blackstone sought to bring the story into an English domain and ensured that his account was incorporated into the <em class="calibre4">Encyclopædia Britannica</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1083" href="#calibre_link-611" class="calibre6">31</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, the legend met with considerable skepticism in England. One author qualified it as a product of French patriotism and declared it “extremely improbable.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1084" href="#calibre_link-1394" class="calibre6">32</a>
</sup>
 The first comprehensive English treatment of marine insurance, published in 1787, relayed the versions given by both the Savarys and Montesquieu but concluded that the origin of marine insurance “is involved in so much obscurity” that no satisfactory explanation could be offered.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1085" href="#calibre_link-1395" class="calibre6">33</a>
</sup>
 Following unusual reasoning, another author described the development of bills of exchange as “a little uncertain” but ultimately backed the idea that Jews were their inventors, “because I have observed that, generally speaking, the Jews to this day practice this kind of commerce most, and understand it best of any people in the world.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1086" href="#calibre_link-1396" class="calibre6">34</a>
</sup>
 This is the only instance I have encountered of an author invoking firsthand experience to maintain that Jews’ commercial conduct was consistent with the spirit of the legend and thus confirmed its veracity. Meanwhile, a translation of a German work at the close of the century introduced a new criterion for dismissing the legend: empirical verification. In 1690, Jacques Dupuis de la Serra had questioned the tale on account of its incoherence (<a href="#calibre_link-298" class="calibre6">chapter 5</a>
 ); now the legend was rejected because “no proof” supported it.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1087" href="#calibre_link-1397" class="calibre6">35</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="172" id="calibre_link-1737"></span>
 Only the followers of Montesquieu, fewer in Britain than on the Continent, clung to the positive depiction of Jews as having devised financial instruments able to undercut autocratic rulers and promote the flow of private credit. The translation of Montesquieu’s <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 into English (1750) and the simultaneous publication of Beccaria’s <em class="calibre4">A Discourse on Public Œconomy and Commerce</em>
 (1769) in Italian, French, and English popularized the nexus between Jews’ persecution and their inventiveness, a connection that economic writer Thomas Mortimer (1730&ndash;1810) repeated without any shadow of a doubt.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1088" href="#calibre_link-1398" class="calibre6">36</a>
</sup>
 Montesquieu’s version of the legend was also echoed in several prefaces to technical works on bills of exchange, on which it conferred a historical veneer.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1089" href="#calibre_link-1399" class="calibre6">37</a>
</sup>
 But its real megaphone was Sir James Steuart (1713&ndash;1780), a Jacobite lord who lived in exile until 1763. Steuart’s treatise on political economy could not compete in originality with the economic writings of such giants of his time as Quesnay, Cantillon, Turgot, Hume, and Smith, but it is estimated that outside of Britain, through the 1780s, it was better known and more frequently cited than <em class="calibre4">The Wealth of Nations</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1090" href="#calibre_link-1400" class="calibre6">38</a>
</sup>
 Steuart followed Montesquieu’s version of the legend closely, but he too added his own touches: while Montesquieu regarded bills of exchange as the preeminent credit instrument of private merchants who sought to escape the rapaciousness of despotic rulers, Steuart included the legend in a vigorous defense of public credit.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1091" href="#calibre_link-1401" class="calibre6">39</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In short, the legend met a dual reception in England, as it had in France: works indebted to Cleirac or the Savarys cast Jews in a negative light but also led to a search for more stringent empirical verification, while those that followed Montesquieu placed Jews on a pedestal and dispensed with the need for accuracy. In England, however, Montesquieu’s version was marginalized and the legend never figured in contentious debates about the political status of Jews. In fact, by comparing the fate of the legend in France and Britain, we find that the political impact of representations of Jews’ economic roles on the two sides of the Channel was not as divergent as is usually believed.</p>
<p class="indent">John Toland, the earliest proponent of granting prosperous Jews who relocated to Britain the status of subjects of the crown (“naturalization”), insisted that Jews made vital contributions to international trade and did not demand that they be “regenerated,” but he was an unconventional figure. In 1714, Toland, an Irish Catholic who first converted to Anglicanism and later renounced Christianity altogether, published a pamphlet marshaling economic arguments in favor of allowing all Jews in the kingdom to be recognized as subjects of the crown.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1092" href="#calibre_link-1402" class="calibre6">40</a>
</sup>
 He was writing at a time of fierce disputes about the terms under which foreign Protestants should be naturalized. His pamphlet appeared in the same year that the Whigs regained control of Parliament. In 1753, <span title="173" id="calibre_link-1794"></span>
 Parliament passed the “Jewish Naturalization Act” allowing affluent foreign-born Jews to become subjects of the crown without taking the sacrament (a privilege that would entitle them, among other things, to enter all branches of trade and own ships). Another defender of this act, the Anglican reverend Josiah Tucker, who was also an effective polemicist and economic writer, spilled considerable ink to argue, counter to prevailing views, that this policy promoted British commercial interests.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1093" href="#calibre_link-1403" class="calibre6">41</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Naturalization in mid-eighteenth-century Britain was an elite phenomenon rather than a political and legal status analogous to postrevolutionary French citizenship, yet it succeeded in stirring up an enormous uproar. Those opposing it mounted a vicious public campaign, waged by means of pamphlets, newspaper articles, sermons, plays, etchings, and public gatherings. In the end, the so-called “Jew Bill” was revoked. Neither its promoters nor its detractors seem to have invoked the legend of the Jewish invention of financial instruments in favor of or against it, but the resistance to the act proved in-grained stereotypes about Jewish usury to be stronger than the efforts to yoke Jewish commercial prowess to pro-naturalization arguments. In the many satires that circulated at the time, “Jews were widely represented as speculators and plundering usurers.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1094" href="#calibre_link-1404" class="calibre6">42</a>
</sup>
 The protagonist of one sketch, “Mr. Judas the Broker,” is illustrative of such representations: a shadowy figure, Mr. Judas is willing to sell stocks in defiance of the Bubble Act, which in the aftermath of the 1720 crash forbade joint-stock companies lacking a royal charter from trading their shares.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1095" href="#calibre_link-1405" class="calibre6">43</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">In France, as we saw, advocates of Jewish emancipation avoided pro-commercial arguments in making their case (<a href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre6">chapter 6</a>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1096" href="#calibre_link-1406" class="calibre6">44</a>
</sup>
 In Britain, such arguments were marshaled in favor of the more modest proposal of granting naturalization to a select group of prosperous Jews, but they backfired because large segments of the public perceived Jews as selfish speculators. Only in 1867 did adult male Jews gain the right to vote in Britain.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2072">Holy Roman Empire</h3>
<p class="noindent">Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 appeared in German translation in 1676, a year after the French original, and became the earliest vehicle for the legend’s transmission into the German-language commercial and legal literature.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1097" href="#calibre_link-1407" class="calibre6">45</a>
</sup>
 Montesquieu’s influence followed in time. With regard to the claim that Jews might have invented marine insurance and/or bills of exchange, eighteenth-century German economic writers confirmed their well-known debt to French authors. But by reconstructing the trajectory of the legend and the objections to <span title="174" id="calibre_link-1665"></span>
 it, we can go a step further to map the landscape of German debates on the morality of commercial society and its relationship to the state during the eighteenth century. In the Holy Roman Empire, as elsewhere, this issue was treated in different, if overlapping, genres: merchant handbooks, which were most directly modeled on that of Savary; legal disquisitions on the origins of mercantile contracts, a literature largely unknown in Britain because of the feebler influence that Roman law exerted there; encyclopedias, some devoted to universal knowledge, others to trade alone; Cameralism, an amorphous and distinctively German tradition of academic writing on the economy and the fiscal needs of the state aimed at administrators and government officials; and, finally, treatises on the emerging “science of commerce” by Francophile admirers of Montesquieu.</p>
<p class="indent">Mentions of Jews crop up in all of these genres and yet have been overlooked by scholars of both German political economy and central European Jews. These mentions are indebted to the manifold traditions we have examined so far but also reflect the conditions of regional and international trade in central Europe and the circumstances in which Jews lived and worked there. The stock market, essentially a London and Amsterdam institution (the Paris Bourse took off slowly only during the last quarter of the eighteenth century), was absent from central Europe during this time. Overall, the Jewish presence in Prussia, Austria, and the smaller German principalities and city-states was spotty and marked by tense relations with sovereigns and neighbors. Hamburg was the exception: in 1612 the Senate won its battle with the Lutheran clergy and allowed a small number of Sephardic merchants engaged in Atlantic trade to settle in the city-state with their families. A few Jewish merchants, most of them from Germany or Poland, were also active at the international fairs of Leipzig and Frankfurt am Main, which experienced a revival in the eighteenth century.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1098" href="#calibre_link-1408" class="calibre6">46</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The social structure of the Jewish communities in the Habsburg Empire was strictly pyramidal, with the mass of poor folks excluded from artisanal professions and confined to small-scale retail topped by a few so-called court Jews, wealthy financiers and army suppliers who negotiated basic privileges for the entire community in return for their services to the ruler. Jews across the German-speaking territories were thus vulnerable to the will of the sovereign and were largely identified with poverty and criminality. In spite of these conditions, Christian merchants perceived even the poorest Jewish shopkeepers, salesmen, and peddlers as competitors and lamented their ostensibly excessive economic power, as shown by the 1672 “Petitions of the Estates to the Great Elector” of Brandenburg-Prussia.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1099" href="#calibre_link-1409" class="calibre6">47</a>
</sup>
 A century later, a prominent <span title="175" id="calibre_link-1798"></span>
 economic writer condemned all peddlers, and Jews in particular, for the poor quality of their merchandise.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1100" href="#calibre_link-1410" class="calibre6">48</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">More than their contemporaries elsewhere, German Orientalists and Biblical scholars produced virulent attacks on Judaism under the guise of learned exposés, joining new scholarly expertise with older theological polemics. Johann Andreas Eisenmenger’s 1700 <em class="calibre4">Entdecktes Judenthum</em>
 (<em class="calibre4">Judaism Unmasked</em>
 ) was the most hateful of these works, but many more, including one by the noted Johannes David Michaelis, relied on Hebraica to demonstrate Jews’ alleged inferiority and lack of respect toward Christians.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1101" href="#calibre_link-1411" class="calibre6">49</a>
</sup>
 In less scholarly publications, the portrait of Jews was rarely more favorable. By the late 1740s, writers like Christian Fürchtegott Gellert and, more famously, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing were offering positive representations of virtuous Jewish merchants. However, these works have stood the test of time not only because of their literary achievements but also because they rejected the then-dominant association of commerce with fraud, and with the Jews who symbolized it. Now forgotten are many more unremarkable texts that aired more conventional views.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1102" href="#calibre_link-1412" class="calibre6">50</a>

 To a certain Johann Ludolf Holst, a law graduate and resident of Hamburg, the city with the largest resident community of international Jewish merchants in the Holy Roman Empire, we owe an extensive and unsympathetic treatment of the economic roles of Jews.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">Emancipation was not imminent in central Europe. The 1782 Edict of Toleration of Habsburg emperor Joseph II paled in comparison to the privileges that Catholic states like Venice and Tuscany had granted Jews two centuries earlier. But because of the insistence of a few reformist voices, Jewish and gentile alike, the question of the “civic improvement” of Jews made its way into German-language works. Written on behalf of the Jews of Alsace, Christian Wilhelm von Dohm’s case for granting civic and political rights to Jews was more audacious than any other to date, and it was built on knowledge and arguments that German authors had debated for half a century.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1104" href="#calibre_link-1414" class="calibre6">52</a>
</sup>
 Dohm’s treatise, however, had a more immediate impact in France, where it inspired debates in favor of and against Jewish emancipation (<a href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre6">chapter 6</a>

<p class="indent">Seeking to instruct future administrators on how to strengthen the welfare of their polities, Cameralist textbooks outlined methods to boost demographic growth (which was seen as the source and proof of all riches) and improve output in agriculture, manufacturing, and mining. Neither private nor public finance was key to Cameralist authors. Private finance appeared to them extraneous to the economic sphere of government administration, while the public debt was a moot topic because German rulers borrowed from bankers <span title="176" id="calibre_link-1723"></span>
 rather than subjects. By contrast, private credit was a more important theme in merchant handbooks, which owed a great deal to Savary and his sons. Two authors were instrumental in disseminating the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange as part of their efforts to emulate French compilers of dictionaries of trade: Paul Jacob Marperger (1656&ndash;1730) and Carl Günter Ludovici (1707&ndash;1778).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1106" href="#calibre_link-1416" class="calibre6">54</a>
</sup>
 A member of the Prussian Royal Society of Sciences, Marperger served as a commercial court judge and took upon himself the task of assembling “the unwritten merchant laws or their so-called style” in order to guide judges like himself and other bureaucrats overseeing commercial disputes and councils. A professor of philosophy and later rector of the University of Leipzig, Ludovici invested considerable energy in large editorial projects, including the completion of a dictionary conceived by Johann Heinrich Zedler (1706&ndash;1763) that proved a monument of eighteenth-century German encyclopedic knowledge.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1107" href="#calibre_link-1417" class="calibre6">55</a>
</sup>
 All these projects relied greatly on the Savary brothers’ <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire universel de commerce</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Through the usual mixture of deliberate plagiarism and thoughtless reproductions, the legend of the Jewish origin of bills of exchange that the Savarys had canonized infiltrated these German-language works. But German writers also expressed more doubts about it than their French counterparts. In 1709 Marperger relayed the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange in full (including the names of the medieval French kings cited by Savary as responsible for banishing Jews from the Kingdom) but concluded that “it is more likely that the Ghibellines, who were expelled from Italy by the Guelph faction and for the most part moved to Germany and to the Low Countries, were responsible for the first real beginning of the trade in bills of exchange.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1108" href="#calibre_link-1418" class="calibre6">56</a>
</sup>
 He gave a clearer reason for preferring an Italian source over a Jewish one a few years later in a book dedicated specifically to the history and functions of banks. There, he added that he was “certain that, as the Italians are clever tradesmen down to this very day and since most of the institutions that serve and facilitate maritime commerce come from them, the useful practice of banks must, too.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1109" href="#calibre_link-1419" class="calibre6">57</a>

 Zedler’s <em class="calibre4">Lexicon</em>
 took notice of Marperger’s update but also asserted that medieval French Jews invented marine insurance.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1110" href="#calibre_link-1420" class="calibre6">58</a>

 as well.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, German authors tended to credit Italians rather than Jews with having expanded medieval commercial and banking activities. Today we know that their hypothesis is sounder than the rival interpretation focusing on Jews, but we also reject the wisdom of looking for a single point of origin for any complex phenomenon. Early signs of diffidence toward this search <span title="177" id="calibre_link-1818"></span>
 became visible at the beginning of the eighteenth century. As the proliferation of didactic multivolume compilations led to the mechanical reproduction of various tales of origins, German authors questioned the legend’s soundness more than readers elsewhere. A prolific author, Marperger changed his mind on the matter: only five years after he endorsed the idea that Ghibellines had invented bills of exchange, he aired an altogether different theory, arguing that these credit instruments were born out of the needs of long-distance trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1112" href="#calibre_link-1422" class="calibre6">60</a>
</sup>
 In yet another major compilation about “the science of commerce,” Ludovici, under the influence of Dupuis de la Serra, followed suit: while endorsing a probable Florentine origin, he also insisted that all financial contracts were a spontaneous response to the increasing complexity of international commerce.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1113" href="#calibre_link-1423" class="calibre6">61</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Legal scholars also injected a healthy dose of skepticism about the putatively Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange into the debate. Steeped in Roman law, German jurists before and after the Reformation were equally versed in Scholastic and canonistic debates on usury. Those of Protestant confession, including the noted Wolfgang Adam Lauterbach (1618&ndash;1678), a member of the faculty of law in Tübingen, were more likely to reject Aristotelian doctrines about the sterility of money and defend the legitimacy of credit instruments.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1114" href="#calibre_link-1160" class="calibre6">62</a>
</sup>
 More generally, all jurists scrutinized the contractual nature of marine insurance and bills of exchange. By stating that “insurance policies and bills of exchange were unknown to Roman jurisprudence,” Cleirac had intervened&mdash;correctly&mdash;in lively and consequential debates about the existence or absence of Roman law antecedents of the contractual obligations that fueled Europe’s commercial expansion (<a href="#calibre_link-4" class="calibre6">chapter 3</a>
 ). German jurisprudence refined this point of contention. Discussions of maritime and commercial law, the bulk of which appeared in Latin dissertations, generally omitted any reference to the legend. Instead, they offered lengthy digressions on the dubious use of Cicero and other classical authors as evidence of the Roman origins of modern credit instruments.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1115" href="#calibre_link-1424" class="calibre6">63</a>
</sup>
 As part of these inquiries, a few German jurists discovered Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 and, with it, the fabled story of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange, but their interest in the Bordelais author had more to do with the range of legal sources for the study of maritime law he provided, particularly the first modern edition of the Laws of Oléron.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1116" href="#calibre_link-1425" class="calibre6">64</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">While German authors subjected the legend to empirical scrutiny, Montesquieu’s influence once again pushed interpretation in the opposite direction, encouraging the view that the tale was unquestionably true and conveying an uplifting message. Even before <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 was translated into <span title="178" id="calibre_link-1714"></span>
 German in 1782, many German scholars had read it in French.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1117" href="#calibre_link-1130" class="calibre6">65</a>
</sup>
 No one drew more inspiration from it than Jakob Friedrich von Bielfeld (1717&ndash;1770), a graduate of Leiden University and court master of Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia. In reproducing Montesquieu’s account of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, Bielfeld applauded those “good princes” who chose to protect the tiny pieces of paper that had become “sacred” to the entire <em class="calibre4">Europe commerçante</em>

</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of these multiple influences, by the end of the eighteenth century a broad spectrum of theories about the origins of European credit instruments characterized German economic literature, ranging from full endorsements of the legend<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1120" href="#calibre_link-1427" class="calibre6">67</a>

 to the preference for an Italian beginning<sup class="calibre7">

<a id="calibre_link-1123" href="#calibre_link-1430" class="calibre6">70</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Out of this heterogeneity, one adaptation stands out because less than a century later it would become a commonplace explanation among German academics of the decline of Jews’ presumed economic supremacy in the early Middle Ages and the rise of postmedieval Europe (<a href="#calibre_link-846" class="calibre6">chapter 8</a>
 ). The Cameralist writer Friedrich Christoph Jonathan Fischer (1750&ndash;1797) sought to claim pride of place for medieval German merchants in the history of the origins of bills of exchange and, possibly, marine insurance. He argued that those inventions appeared at a time when the ingenuity of Christian merchants had been stimulated by a desire to free themselves from the domination of “Jews and Lombards.” For Fischer, “Christians could not watch indifferently the benefits that Jews and Lombards derived from their trade in money and from their business in bills of exchange [<em class="calibre4">Wechselgeschäft</em>
 ].”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1124" href="#calibre_link-1431" class="calibre6">71</a>
</sup>
 As the next chapter will show, the doyen of the German Historical School, Wilhelm Roscher, would later elaborate on this idea that, having copied Jews’ financial devices, Christians grew envious of their skills. One of the most influential narratives of the rise of European commerce and antisemitism therefore had its roots in a twist of the legend with which we are grappling.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2073">Italian Peninsula</h3>
<p class="noindent">In spite of the wide resonance that Montesquieu’s work had with Italian Enlightenment figures, the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange left only scant footprints on the Italian peninsula. There, a long tradition of merchant manuals and treatises on maritime and commercial law dating back <span title="179" id="calibre_link-1719"></span>
 to the late Middle Ages had fostered considerable knowledge of these credit instruments and their historical evolution. In 1641, six years before the publication of Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 , a Latin treatise on exchange dealings likened their development to a river formed from a multiplicity of small contributory streams&mdash;a metaphor that signaled the impossibility of determining with precision where the river originated.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1125" href="#calibre_link-1432" class="calibre6">72</a>
</sup>
 The Jewish presence on the peninsula was also radically different from that in southwestern France. During the sixteenth century, under the dual pressure of ecclesiastical and state authorities, Iberian Jews fleeing to Venice, Livorno, and the Papal States were given shelter as long as they relinquished their Christian identity. As a consequence, crypto-Judaism was a relatively short-lived phenomenon in Italy.</p>
<p class="indent">The tendency of Italian writers to claim the invention of bills of exchange for their ancestors also contributed to their rejection of the legend. In the earliest refutation of Cleirac, in 1690, Dupuis de la Serra proposed that the honor of having invented early credit instruments go to Florentine émigrés to Lyon. Predictably, this hypothesis met with a warm reception in Italy, where its spread was aided by a Latin and Italian translation of Dupuis de la Serra.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1126" href="#calibre_link-1132" class="calibre6">73</a>
</sup>
 Giuseppe Lorenzo Maria Casaregi (1670&ndash;1737), a jurist and preeminent scholar of commercial law, followed Dupuis de la Serra’s account in attributing the invention of bills of exchange to Guelf expatriates in Lyon, thus correcting the references that peppered the French literature treating Guelfs and Ghibel-lines as interchangeable groups.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1128" href="#calibre_link-1433" class="calibre6">74</a>

 Several other Tuscan commentators naturally welcomed this theory. Some stressed the Florentines’ refugee status. Others, like Giovan Francesco Pagnini (1714&ndash;1789), a scholar of agrarian reforms and finance and a high official in the Tuscan Habsburg government, emphasized their leadership in international banking.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">In Livorno, the Italian city with the highest proportion of Jewish residents and the most tolerant policies toward them, the brothers Pompeo and Ascanio Baldasseroni, authors of treatises on exchange dealings and marine insurance, respectively, confirmed their preference for the Florentine origin of bills of exchange. Pompeo declared that Tuscany should count not only Galileo Galilei and Amerigo Vespucci among its “glories,” but also the inventors of bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1131" href="#calibre_link-1435" class="calibre6">76</a>

 For Ascanio, Savary and Beawes were not to be trusted. Although he argued that Jews displayed a “natural inclination” for trade in bills of exchange and excelled at that activity, he asked that equal if not more credence be given to the Florentine hypothesis.<sup class="calibre7">

 A Genoese author had little to add except to mark his territory in the perpetual rivalry between Italian city-states, <span title="180" id="calibre_link-1738"></span>
 paying homage to the role that the Genoese, not just the Florentines, had played in spreading the invention of bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">

</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the mounting dismissal of the legend by those most versed in the legal and practical facets of commerce, Montesquieu’s version of the tale of Jewish invention insinuated itself into the works of the most influential figures of the Italian Enlightenment. Between 1754 and 1779, five academic chairs in what came to be known as political economy, which at the time was described alternately as “the science of commerce,” “mechanics and commerce,” “economic sciences,” or “civil economy,” were established in Naples, Milan, Modena, Catania, and Palermo. The occupants of the first two, Antonio Genovesi in Naples (1712&ndash;1769) and Cesare Beccaria in Milan (1738&ndash;1794), were also the most notable. They differed in their depiction of Jews’ role in the making of European commercial society, but both discussed the topic.</p>
<p class="indent">Genovesi was, along with Ferdinando Galiani (1728&ndash;1787), the leading figure of the Neapolitan Enlightenment. His <em class="calibre4">Delle lezioni di commercio</em>
 (1765&ndash;1767) represented the culmination of an effort to synthesize a traditional eighteenth-century conception of commerce as promoting friendship between peoples and nations with the growing impetus, modeled on Newtonian science and pioneered by Galiani, to devise universal laws for the economy. The book was very well received and, as its numerous translations testify, earned Genovesi a place in the European pantheon of scholars who broke ground in the emerging field of political economy. In a chapter devoted to paper money (“Della moneta di carta”), he praised bills of exchange for supporting foreign trade and paper money for facilitating domestic trade. He also maintained that persecuted Jews at the time of the Crusades began to use bills of exchange in order to bring their assets abroad safely, implying that they had had a role in the early use of those instruments but also that it was a role that did not coincide with the Christian goal of reconquering the Holy Land.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1135" href="#calibre_link-1437" class="calibre6">79</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Other references to Jews in the rest of Genovesi’s work revealed a darker view of their economic roles than had been found in Montesquieu, whom he echoed only in assuming that “during the barbarous times that followed Greek and Latin politeness [<em class="calibre4">politezza</em>
 ],” Jews dominated trade. Genovesi took it upon himself to enumerate the evils of Jewish moneylending, which he declared “reached up to 30 and 40 and 100” percent interest rates until charitable lending institutions set up by Franciscan friars (the <em class="calibre4">Monti di pietà</em>
 ) put an end to those “bloody usuries.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1136" href="#calibre_link-1438" class="calibre6">80</a>
</sup>
 Writing from Naples, a city that had chased Jews out in the early sixteenth century (except for a brief interlude in the 1740s), Genovesi depicted Jews as parasitical pawnbrokers and thus deviated from Montesquieu’s template.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="181" id="calibre_link-1717"></span>
 Not so Cesare Beccaria, the celebrated author of the first European treatise condemning torture and the death penalty, who did not stray far at all from Montesquieu, offering an equally positive portrait of Jewish involvement in the creation of modern commercial society. On the occasion of his appointment to his chair in Milan in 1769, Beccaria delivered a speech that painted in broad strokes the historical process by which European commerce had achieved its dominance. Published simultaneously in Italian, French, and English, this brief text circulated widely. Beccaria glossed over the details and resorted to a more cautious formulation whereby Jews did not necessarily invent but certainly “<em class="calibre4">had recourse to</em>
 [<em class="calibre4">ricorrono</em>
 in the Italian original, <em class="calibre4">recourent</em>
 in the French translation] the invention of bills of exchange to save their treasures from the rapaciousness of tyrannical inquisitions.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1137" href="#calibre_link-1439" class="calibre6">81</a>
</sup>
 Paraphrasing Montesquieu, Beccaria also praised bills of exchange for their ability to “augment to a great degree the certainty and readiness of communication among the trading nations.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1138" href="#calibre_link-1440" class="calibre6">82</a>
</sup>
 He used commerce and communication as synonyms and viewed bills of exchange as the pillars of both. Like Montesquieu, Beccaria portayed Jews as having invented a tool of resistance against tyranny.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1139" href="#calibre_link-1441" class="calibre6">83</a>
</sup>
 Adapting another adage dear to Montesquieu, he grouped bills of exchange with the compass and the Spanish and Portuguese transoceanic explorations, the two other apexes of Western civilization, and added a patriotic touch by singling out the contributions of the Italian “genius” Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p class="indent">Montesquieu’s authoritativeness at this time was so great that few dared to disprove him. One exception was the Tuscan physician, botanist, and geographer Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti (1712&ndash;1783), who challenged the philosophe’s account of the birth of bills of exchange and did so, unlike Dupuis de la Serra, on strictly empirical grounds. Describing a manuscript containing the works of the noted thirteenth-century Pisan mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, Tozzetti remarked that bills of exchange had been well known in Pisa at that time and concluded that both Montesquieu’s anecdote and any accounts attributing the invention of bills of exchange to Florentine émigrés in Lyon were proven wrong by this text.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1140" href="#calibre_link-1442" class="calibre6">84</a>
</sup>
 When Domenico Alberto Azuni (1749&ndash;1827), a foremost jurist and theorist of commercial law, took on the task of updating the Savary brothers’ dictionary of commerce, he incorporated Tozzetti’s correction.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1141" href="#calibre_link-1443" class="calibre6">85</a>
</sup>
 In so doing, he not only exalted Tuscany’s precocious capitalist development, but also proved the value of source criticism.</p>
<p class="indent">Both the supporters and the detractors of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange in eighteenth-century Italy discussed the tale with little regard for the actual status of Jews living on the peninsula. The one exception was a debate that ensued in Mantua, a town then under Habsburg rule <span title="182" id="calibre_link-1681"></span>
 that in the 1770s and 1780s became the fulcrum of reformist initiatives and bitter counterattacks on them. The Jewish community in Mantua traced its origins to the twelfth century and boasted scholars and rabbis of great repute who epitomized the Ashkenazic-Italian tradition predating the arrival of Iberian refugees in the sixteenth century. Thanks to a rich manufacturing tradition, they were not as impoverished as the Jews of Alsace and Lorraine; nevertheless, they were poorer and less acculturated than the Sephardic merchants living in Venice and Livorno.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1142" href="#calibre_link-1444" class="calibre6">86</a>
</sup>
 In the early 1780s, the local nobleman Giovanni Battista Gherardo D’Arco (1739&ndash;1791) and the Jewish physician and <em class="calibre4">maskil</em>
 (Enlightened scholar) Benedetto Frizzi, also known as Benzion Rafael Kohen (1756&ndash;1844), engaged in an acrimonious debate about the Jews’ civic rights (or lack thereof) and in the process rehearsed trite arguments about the economic functions of Jews in Christian society.</p>
<p class="indent">A self-styled physiocrat, D’Arco submitted a formulaic tribute to the civilizing properties of commerce to a prize competition sponsored by the Royal Academy of Marseilles. Denouncing the harm caused by monopolies, he pointed to Jewish businesses as his prime example.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1143" href="#calibre_link-1445" class="calibre6">87</a>
</sup>
 After his work was rejected by the French committee, D’Arco expanded on his view of Jews’ pernicious economic dominance, which he regarded as inseparable from their deviant religious beliefs, in a book with the ominous title <em class="calibre4">On the Influence of the Ghetto on the State</em>
 , which advocated curbing Jewish self-government in the wake of the 1782 Habsburg Edict of Toleration. Borrowing arguments that we have encountered before, and which the Turin jurist Giuseppe Sessa had recently reiterated, D’Arco praised Maria Theresa’s decision to expel Jews from Prague in 1745 as a way of eradicating their “asocial egotism” (<em class="calibre4">egoismo insociale</em>
 ).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1144" href="#calibre_link-1446" class="calibre6">88</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This was the central accusation that Frizzi sought to rebut. Persecution, he maintained, had made Jews circumspect rather than fraudulent, and commerce had instilled in them moderation and allowed them to perform multiple services to the state. He praised Jews not only for excelling at but also for inventing banking activities when expelled from France, as well as for spreading those techniques to all maritime states, including Venice, Amsterdam, and Bordeaux.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1145" href="#calibre_link-1447" class="calibre6">89</a>
</sup>
 Writing after Dohm, Frizzi went further than other contemporary Jewish apologists to extol the financial skills of Jews, but he did so in a context in which full emancipation was not on the table (indeed, he argued for more rather than less Jewish corporate self-government). He did not, however, go as far as taking credit for his people’s supposed invention of bills of exchange&mdash; a telling omission.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2074"><span title="183" id="calibre_link-1745" class="calibre1"></span>
 Iberia</h3>
<p class="noindent">The legend reached Iberia late and had only a slight influence on Spanish and Portuguese debates on the morality of commerce. There are many reasons for its low profile. Early modern Iberian economic thought arguably peaked in the sixteenth century, when moral theologians and a few lay authors produced some of the most sophisticated explanations of the growing credit economy. As in Italy, these writers had a deep knowledge of exchange dealings, the emergence of which they attributed to the natural progression from barter to money and the need to find alternatives to the transport and conversion of minted coins.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1146" href="#calibre_link-1448" class="calibre6">90</a>
</sup>
 During the economic decline of the seventeenth century, advisors and critics of the crown, the so-called <em class="calibre4">arbitristas</em>
 , concentrated on proposing reforms of fiscal and commercial policies. By the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese economic literature had become more dependent on foreign currents of thought and focused on the governance of mainland and imperial territories.</p>
<p class="indent">Imported from abroad, the legend arrived in Iberia via the translations of Bielfeld and Genovesi. A brief if affirming reference to it appeared in terms that echoed Montesquieu in a compilation of the Catalan polymath and editor of medieval Barcelona’s <em class="calibre4">Libro del consulado del mar</em>
 , Antonio de Capmany y Montpalau (1742&ndash;1813).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1147" href="#calibre_link-1449" class="calibre6">91</a>
</sup>
 A different treatise, devoted entirely to bills of exchange, cited Savary and Villani alongside the refutation of their narrative by Dupuis de la Serra.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1148" href="#calibre_link-1450" class="calibre6">92</a>
</sup>
 Bernardo Danvila, a Valencian jurist and scion of a mercantile family, listed multiple possibilities for the origin of bills of exchange, including the Jewish hypothesis, in a chapter on money in his lectures on commerce.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1149" href="#calibre_link-1451" class="calibre6">93</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In the Portuguese world, as elsewhere, scholars rediscovered Cleirac in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, when Enlightenment reformists were advocating the passage of new comprehensive codes. While reading Cleirac as a source of earlier maritime laws, some were also drawn to the legend. The Brazilian economist, jurist, and historian José da Silva Lisboa, Baron and Viscount of Cairu, relied on Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 to compile his own principles of maritime law, in which he recalled various theories about the origins of bills of exchange, including the one attributing their invention to Jews fleeing France in 1182.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1150" href="#calibre_link-1452" class="calibre6">94</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Proponents of economic liberalization at the close of the eighteenth century also clung to the legend, with some embracing more benign versions than others. A treatise inspired by French physiocrats criticized the Spanish <span title="184" id="calibre_link-1643"></span>
 crown for expelling Moriscos, whom it described as refined artisans and farmers. Surveying the sources of a state’s wealth (agriculture, taxes, the arts, industry, money, and coinage), that work referred to the legend to account for the shift from metal currency to bills of exchange and singled out Jews who were forced to flee England and France in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They deposited their assets with people they trusted, the author relayed, and thus drew up written documents that served as models for bills of exchange. In a seemingly neutral tone, he concluded that “the discovery of this secret, which probably existed before among the Jews because of their usuries, facilitated commercial operations.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1151" href="#calibre_link-1453" class="calibre6">95</a>
</sup>
 The laissez-faire economist José Alonso Ortiz also noted that most of the authors he consulted attributed the invention of bills of exchange to persecuted Jews from the times of the Crusades. Ortiz did not defend the idea that Jews invented these bills but expressed certainty that they were among the first to have used them. How could he be so sure? Because Jews’ permanent displacement (“la condición errante de estas gentes”) and continuous persecution had led them to specialize in commerce, he declared, so much so that “they have always been the richest merchants in Europe.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1152" href="#calibre_link-1454" class="calibre6">96</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This assumption went unchallenged in a region that had freed itself of Jews 300 years earlier and where commerce and finance had gained only partial acceptance. Sporadic as these mentions of the legend were on the Iberian peninsula, they were never accompanied by demands for evidence, a reflex that elsewhere in Europe was corroding the credibility of the idea that the most advanced credit instruments were the brainchild of persecuted medieval Jews.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2075">United Provinces</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once they gained independence from the Spanish Low Countries, the Calvinist United Provinces went further than any other early modern European state in removing usury from the domain of moral theology and ecclesiastical power and placing it in the sphere of civil law. In 1658, the estates of Holland and West Friesland ruled that “the question of moneys loaned by banks does not fall within the jurisdiction of church boards, classes, or synods, but comes under the supervision of the civil government,” which takes it upon itself to protect the poor and “to ensure profit for the majority of the population.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1153" href="#calibre_link-1455" class="calibre6">97</a>
</sup>
 As the phrasing of this norm implied, civil authorities saw themselves as being able to both let merchants lending at interest and shield the poor from economic exploitation. Did they succeed?</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="185" id="calibre_link-1666"></span>
 The artwork of the Dutch Golden Age, Simon Schama has shown, not only celebrated opulence but also offered an opportunity for reflection on the ills of profligacy.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1154" href="#calibre_link-1456" class="calibre6">98</a>
</sup>
 But the visual arts were only the most striking vehicle used by elite Dutch culture to express moral concerns about the ubiquity of credit. The printing press did its part, too. The legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange, however, did not establish a firm footing in the Dutch commercial literature. This is all the more remarkable given that Dutch was the second language after German into which Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 was translated in 1683.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1155" href="#calibre_link-1457" class="calibre6">99</a>
</sup>
 It is tempting to jump to the quick conclusion that Amsterdam, the most tolerant city in early modern Europe, offered unparalleled safeguards to its Jewish population and therefore proved impermeable to a legend that, in most renditions, vilified Jews. The hypothesis is plausible, but we need to consider at least two other elements when trying to make sense of the lack of traction that the legend gained in the United Provinces. The first is the relative paucity of handbooks and dictionaries about trade that were written and published in Dutch compared to English, in spite of the pervasiveness of commerce in both societies. The second is the tendency of Dutch authors to invoke Jews to express disapproval of the excesses of the stock market rather than bills of exchange, a trait more consonant with a phenomenon we have already seen in England.</p>
<p class="indent">The United Provinces, a major hub of international trade, produced a remarkably small fraction of the Continent’s <em class="calibre4">ars mercatoria</em>
 . The Dutch population had generally high literacy rates and consumed a great deal of printed economic information in the form of broadsheets, price and stock lists, auction sale advertisements, and other ephemera. Moreover, some of Europe’s most influential theorists of republicanism and international and natural law, from the De La Court brothers to Hugo Grotius, not only were born in Holland but also voiced the intellectual and political predicaments of the milieus in which they lived. Nevertheless, eighteenth-century Dutch printing houses issued fewer merchant dictionaries and manuals than their English, French, and German counterparts, and most of those that were issued offered hands-on instructions rather than investigating the historical and philosophical aspects of commerce.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1156" href="#calibre_link-1458" class="calibre6">100</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Among the exceptions is a manual compiled by the Huguenot refugee Jacques Le Moine de L’Espine, which appeared simultaneously in French and Dutch in Amsterdam in 1694 as <em class="calibre4">La négoce d’Amsterdam</em>
 /<em class="calibre4">Den koophandel van Amsterdam</em>
 . Ten years later, a revised Dutch edition opened with a chapter on the origins of bills of exchange that mixed together bits and pieces from <span title="186" id="calibre_link-1710"></span>
 Cleirac and Savary to relay the legend as a matter of fact.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1157" href="#calibre_link-1459" class="calibre6">101</a>
</sup>
 This text proved to be incredibly popular, with a total of twelve Dutch editions repeating the story of how Jews expelled from France invented bills of exchange. But aside from its inclusion in this well-liked merchant manual, the legend did not figure in many other works, except for the anonymous <em class="calibre4">De koopman</em>
 (<em class="calibre4">The Merchant</em>
 ), a collection of commonplaces that appeared later in the century.<sup class="calibre7">

</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that references to Jews were absent from Dutch public commentaries on commerce and finance. For both those who welcomed it and those who resented it, the presence of a sizable Jewish community in the heart of Holland was predicated on its real and preceived economic contributions to the commonwealth. In 1692, an anonymous piece published in the Dutch periodical <em class="calibre4">Histoire des ouvrages des savants</em>
 (1687&ndash;1709) put it bluntly: Jews “are tolerated for no other reason than the advantages that they bring to commerce,” in spite of the fact that “there is nothing that is more odious to Christianity.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1161" href="#calibre_link-1462" class="calibre6">104</a>
</sup>
 Others voiced more benevolent opinions of Jews’ economic influence, if only to advance their own political agenda. In 1673, an English pamphleteer expressed his admiration for Dutch political economy by praising Amsterdam as a city that used to have nothing by way of commerce until it welcomed the Jews expelled from Iberia.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1162" href="#calibre_link-1463" class="calibre6">105</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">In times of financial crisis these stereotypes quickly acquired a more menacing tone, and Jews were accused of cornering the market. Still a small presence, they received little blame for the bust in tulip bulb prices in 1637, the most massive early speculative scheme gone awry.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1163" href="#calibre_link-1464" class="calibre6">106</a>

 By contrast, the Amsterdam stock market crash of 1688 exposed what Jonathan Israel has called “a new strain of economic anti-Semitism rooted in the mystique of the stock market.”<sup class="calibre7">

 The 1720 South Sea Bubble sent shockwaves through Holland. Amid an explosion of printed material satirizing the “trade in wind,” caricatures of Jews vilified the unsavory financial deals in which they allegedly engaged. Part of the blame for the South Sea disaster fell on foreigners, English and Frenchmen in particular. But the greatest blame was placed on Jews, who were accused of having swindled honest and naïve Dutchmen into making foolish investments. Faced with a possible financial meltdown, Dutch society ceased to distinguish between refined Sephardim (still the majority of Jewish stock traders in 1720) and uncouth Ashkenazim.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">In the United Provinces, the stock market was the source of much contention. The earliest European book entirely devoted to the subject appeared in Amsterdam, with the title <em class="calibre4">Confusión de confusiones</em>
 , in 1688. Its author was a Sephardic Jew, Joseph Penso de la Vega, born in Andalusia but raised in Amsterdam, where he achieved considerable notoriety. In de la Vega’s lifetime, Sephardim became more and more involved in the secondary market of East India Company stock, although they never dominated it. When rumors spread that Stadholder William III was planning to invade England, ranking officials in the city of Amsterdam (all by definition Christian) were equally if not more ready than Sephardic Jews to use insider information in order to sell their East India Company stocks before they took a dive.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">In <em class="calibre4">Confusión de confusiones</em>
 , “a naïve Philosopher” and a “discrete Merchant” seek to understand “the mysterious affair” of the stock market; a “knowledgeable Shareholder” answers their questions in four “curious dialogues.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1171" href="#calibre_link-1472" class="calibre6">114</a>
</sup>
 Jona-than Israel reminds us that Amsterdam Jews strongly favored (and supported financially) William of Orange’s military plans but were frequently portrayed as unpatriotic. In his reading, de la Vega started to write his book precisely when news of William’s expedition became public, in May 1688, and completed it after stock values plummeted in August. For Israel, one of de la Vega’s aims was to cleanse the reputation of Jews, who were seen as having been instrumental in luring a great many modest people into the stock market under the false promise of certain gains.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1172" href="#calibre_link-1473" class="calibre6">115</a>
</sup>
 Others argue instead that <em class="calibre4">Confusión de confusiones</em>
 lacked any original economic insights and aimed solely at entertaining its readers while leaving them with the sense that the stock market was a dangerous place.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1173" href="#calibre_link-1474" class="calibre6">116</a>
</sup>
 In fact, the two interpretations are not incompatible. In the highly charged atmosphere of the time, de la Vega had every reason to embed his defense of Jews’ involvement in the stock market in an entertaining text that portrayed all shareholders and brokers as callous.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="188" id="calibre_link-1740"></span>
 In truth, there are scant explicit references to Jews in the book, which, in the words of a specialist of Dutch Jewry, “contains no reference whatsoever to halakhic issues, and in fact totally ignores any specific Jewish questions” because “the stock exchange was considered to be outside the bounds of Jewish life.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1174" href="#calibre_link-1475" class="calibre6">117</a>
</sup>
 An indirect reference can be found in the last chapter, arguably written after the dramatic stock dive of the summer of 1688, in which de la Vega describes “the climax of the exchange transactions” and deplores a new type of share called the <em class="calibre4">ducaton</em>
 , which Jewish brokers apparently used disproportionally and which had enticed “so many men with small means” to invest in stocks and lose everything.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1175" href="#calibre_link-1476" class="calibre6">118</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Written in Castilian and dedicated to a fellow Sephardi, <em class="calibre4">Confusión de confusiones</em>
 made for a more entertaining read than the standard manual of instructions but was also longwinded and enigmatic. Neither a merchant nor a stock trader, de la Vega had no direct knowledge of business or its relevant technical literature.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1176" href="#calibre_link-1477" class="calibre6">119</a>
</sup>
 Ultimately, he exploited the literary device of the dialogue as a way to avoid dogmatism and air opposing views. To counter the Philosopher’s scorn of the “frightful folly” in which “gamblers and speculators” are all “double-dealers,” he had the Shareholder make a detailed case for how it is possible to invest with moderation and avoid “excesses.”<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">For our purposes, it is important to note that de la Vega never hinted at the legend that attributed to medieval Jews the invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange. To set up his case, the treatise had the Merchant praise the stock market for avoiding the complications of commodity trade (“the importunities of instructions, the shipment of goods, and the circulation of bills of exchange are all so burdensome”).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1178" href="#calibre_link-1479" class="calibre6">121</a>
</sup>
 In any case, in 1688, five years after the translation of Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Le parfait négociant</em>
 into Dutch, the legend only carried negative connotations in the United Provinces, so mentioning it would not have provided a defense of Jews’ financial roles. That said, we should dig deeper into the ways in which early modern Jewish authors did&mdash;and did not&mdash;grapple with the legend as it spread across Europe.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2076">Jewish Voices</h3>
<p class="noindent">Silence is difficult to interpret, but it can be loud. Few Jewish writers before emancipation broached economic subjects in works written in European vernaculars. In the seventeenth century, two rabbis, Simone Luzzatto and Menasseh ben Israel, took it upon themselves to address Christian secular authorities in Venice and London, respectively, with eloquent defenses of Jewish <span title="189" id="calibre_link-1668"></span>
 commerce (<a href="#calibre_link-298" class="calibre6">chapter 5</a>
 ). A century later, in Amsterdam, the Sephardic layman Isaac de Pinto (1717&ndash;1787), an author even more prominent than de la Vega, wrote several works in Portuguese and French. None of them, however, alluded to the possibility that Jews might have invented marine insurance or bills of exchange. Their reticence should not go unnoticed.</p>
<p class="indent">To counter the threat of expulsion faced by Venetian Jews in the 1630s, Luzzatto exaggerated the influence of Jewish merchants beyond any reasonable degree to demonstrate Jews’ utility to society and the state. In the process, he anticipated later arguments by attributing Jews’ contributions to the Venetian economy to structural conditions rather than innate skills: their geographical dispersal, exclusion from artisanal guilds and real estate ownership, and access to Ottoman markets, he posited, led Jews to specialize in overseas trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1179" href="#calibre_link-1480" class="calibre6">122</a>
</sup>
 A decade before Cleirac put the legend into circulation, Luzzatto cleverly appropriated negative stereotypes about Jews’ economic conduct to defend their basic existence in a seventeenth-century mercantilist state.</p>
<p class="indent">Luzzatto had considerable knowledge of the financial instruments used by international merchants, including bills of exchange. He probably issued the most lenient ruling a rabbi had delivered up to that moment in favor of those credit instruments that, according to stricter interpretations of Jewish law, infringed on usury prohibitions.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1180" href="#calibre_link-1481" class="calibre6">123</a>
</sup>
 However, he did not mention the Jewish invention of bills of exchange when describing Jews’ commercial talents in his plea to the Venetian authorities. Nor did Menasseh ben Israel in his “Humble Addresses” to Oliver Cromwell, which borrowed generously from Luzzatto’s arguments. Ben Israel’s silence is even more revealing than Luzzatto’s, because his apologetics stressed the “naturall instinct” for commerce with which “Providence and mercy of God” had endowed the Jews in the diaspora.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1181" href="#calibre_link-1482" class="calibre6">124</a>
</sup>
 His choice was in sync with that of most supporters of the 1656 readmission of Jews, among whom many were Puritans, who shunned economic arguments in favor of those predicated on religious millenarianism.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1182" href="#calibre_link-1483" class="calibre6">125</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Best known for his rebuttal of Voltaire’s disparaging attacks on Jews, de Pinto moved in high social and literary circles in Amsterdam, Paris, and London, and even tried his hand at international diplomacy.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1183" href="#calibre_link-957" class="calibre6">126</a>

 His economic writings in French, aimed at a gentile audience, largely avoided any specifically Jewish themes.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1184" href="#calibre_link-1484" class="calibre6">127</a>
</sup>
 However, they offered forceful and learned defenses of the economic policies and attitudes that favored the types of activities in which Jews were most involved. Weighing in on a controversy that was raging at the time, de Pinto denounced the equation of luxury with corruption and challenged the physiocratic doctrines of the Marquis of Mirabeau, the Count of <span title="190" id="calibre_link-1778"></span>
 Mirabeau’s father, which put agriculture ahead of commerce, as well as Hume’s denunciation of spiraling national debt.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1185" href="#calibre_link-1485" class="calibre6">128</a>
</sup>
 Instead, he glorified both public and private credit. In passing, he praised Iberian Jews as honest, industrious, and good subjects, but mostly left it to his readers to infer that Jews made positive contributions to the economic activities for which he advocated.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1186" href="#calibre_link-992" class="calibre6">129</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">As noted earlier, we have no way of knowing whether the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange existed in oral form before Cleirac published his commentary on the Rouen rules about maritime insurance. What we do know is that even if it did, Jewish authors did not embrace it as a weapon of self-defense. We also know that they hesitated to use it even after Montesquieu gave the tale of Jewish financial creativity a positive spin. De Pinto cited or echoed Montesquieu more than once in his arguments in favor of commerce but never recounted the version of the legend that appeared in <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 . A century and a half would pass after the appearance of Cleirac’s commentary of 1647 before a Jewish author felt he could commit the narrative to print.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1187" href="#calibre_link-1486" class="calibre6">130</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">That task fell to Isaac D’Israeli, father of the future British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, in his <em class="calibre4">Vaurien</em>
 , a minor satirical novel published in 1797 that was meant to expose the superficiality of his age. Finance was one of the novel’s targets, alongside French “philosophie” and republicanism. “Enormous wealth is obtained by speculations; we have become a nation of jobbers,” the book declared.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1188" href="#calibre_link-1487" class="calibre6">131</a>
</sup>
 Unlike his Tory predecessors, D’Israeli used the term “jobbers” to refer to all Britons, not Jews alone. A fierce critic of traditional Judaism, he described Vaurien, the novel’s main character, as a “Jewish philosopher,” a pork-eating fellow and admirer of Moses Mendelssohn who exposes the absurdity of many prejudices targeting Jews while expressing other prejudices of his own, such as the alleged contrast between “the physiognomy as well as the customs” of Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1189" href="#calibre_link-1488" class="calibre6">132</a>
</sup>
 For Vaurien, the Jews’ “commercial character” is the result, not the cause, of their dispersal and suffering: “Christian injustice produced Jewish usury” and turned Jews into “objects of national pillage.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1190" href="#calibre_link-1489" class="calibre6">133</a>
</sup>
 In a historical commentary appended to this fictional speech, D’Israeli added: “Despair with the Jews was the parent of invention, and bills of exchange were imagined by them.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1191" href="#calibre_link-1490" class="calibre6">134</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In short, D’Israeli embraced and magnified Montesquieu’s positive depiction of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange. More than Montesquieu, he linked Jews’ persecution explicitly to their creativity. Writing only a few years after the emancipation of French Jews, however, he did not attach any political valence to the legend, in spite of the fact that Jews in Britain remained legally dis advantaged. His contribution resided elsewhere. A Jewish author, D’Israeli <span title="191" id="calibre_link-1779"></span>
 espoused and amplified Montesquieu’s idea that Jews had played a pivotal role in the arc of European civilization. He thus advanced a current of Jewish scholarship that flourished throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and that had as its objective the enumeration of “Jewish contributions to civilization.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1192" href="#calibre_link-1491" class="calibre6">135</a>
</sup>
 In a later publication titled <em class="calibre4">The Genius of Judaism</em>
 (1833), D’Israeli expanded on his earlier argument: forced into “the most humiliating industry,” that is, “the commerce of money,” he declared, Jews were able to bring it “to a noble perfection”; by rendering fortunes invisible, “their genius produced the wonderful invention of bills of exchange,” which, together with “the art of printing . . . are sources of civilization, and connect together, as in one commonwealth, the whole universe.” Eventually, though, he added, the Jews’ “successful pursuits worked their own fatality.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1193" href="#calibre_link-1492" class="calibre6">136</a>
</sup>
 Resentment followed triumph and led Christians to victimize those who had given them access to the most useful financial tools.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, D’Israeli’s treatment of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange sheds new light on two important discourses. Once introduced into the genre of Jewish contributions to civilization, the legend came to occupy a niche in Jews’ collective self-fashioning. In the 1820s, for example, in a petition to Pope Leo XII, the Jews of Rome listed their ancestors’ invention of bills of exchange and banking as evidence of the positive influence Jews had on industry and commerce everywhere, as well as their ability to incite emulation among non-Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1194" href="#calibre_link-1493" class="calibre6">137</a>
</sup>
 Furthermore, D’Israeli’s emphasis on Christian resentment of Jewish financial inventiveness&mdash;an emphasis that, as we saw, the German Cameralist Fischer had recently aired&mdash;replaced Montesquieu’s version of the legend and became a new topos. As Michael Toch has demonstrated, and as the next chapter will show, nineteenth-century German academic works, whether by antisemitic scholars or Jewish apologists, cultivated the idea that Jews had dominated international trade in the early Middle Ages before being reduced to the status of pawnbrokers in the thirteenth century.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1195" href="#calibre_link-1494" class="calibre6">138</a>
</sup>
 The systematic reconstruction of the legend’s meandering paths that this and earlier chapters have pursued thus reveals something new about how this well-known scholarly consensus came to be.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2077">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Geologists designate as karstic certain landscapes, such as the borderlands between Italy and Slovenia, in which surface and groundwaters shape the terrain of soluble rocks by carving out large caves beneath the soil. Karstic landscapes are a topography of sinkholes and streams that disappear abruptly <span title="192" id="calibre_link-1864"></span>
 where they seep into the ground. Most streams continue to flow underground, but occasionally, some reemerge and erode the surface, only to run underground again at a later point&mdash;a process that is repeated over time. Scientists have only a modest ability to predict the courses of these aquifers&mdash;that is, when and where they will resurface and how they will mold the soil. By analogy, we can think of the discursive and material contexts covered in this chapter as soluble rocks and the manifold versions of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange as the corrosive streams that plunge underground and reappear from time to time&mdash;never in exactly the same guise, sometimes leaving only a minor trace, and other times creating more durable paths.</p>
<p class="indent">This analogy brings into relief some of the challenges we confront when we attempt to uncover how ideas are forged, disseminated, and refashioned. A number of cultural and intellectual historians have made creative use of the term “morphology,” a neologism coined by Goethe while touring the botanical gardens of southern Italy and now the name of a branch of biology and linguistics, in order to make sense of similarities between ideas and cultural forms that manifest in disparate times and places and that, in the absence of direct lines of transmission, might otherwise seem unrelated. Critics have faulted these efforts for their tendency to recognize certain equivalences and not others or to overplay analogies between different versions of the same trope in spite of the fact that those differences might be equally revealing.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1196" href="#calibre_link-1495" class="calibre6">139</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">By choosing karstic topography rather than morphology as a metaphor, I emphasize the intricate and sometimes unpredictable webs of meaning that connected a wide range of associations between Jews and credit across the landscape that I have surveyed. I do so to account for a central struggle of my inquiry: after the late Middle Ages, Christian associations of Jews with money displayed remarkable stability because they combined and recombined a set of preexisting tropes, yet these associations were not immutable. Our task is to interpret small differences, the hardest ones to decipher. To do so requires that we stress the permanence of discursive traditions alongside local struggles and the intentional disturbance introduced by certain authors while simultaneously making room for contingency&mdash;a balancing act that is hard to capture in a single formula but that I attempt to perform throughout the entire book.</p>
<p class="indent">Not every narrative of the development of European commercial society, even those found in merchant handbooks, focused on the introduction of bills of exchange. In the stadial conception of history embraced by John Locke, Hume, and Smith, the key moment in this narrative hinged on the earlier transition <span title="193" id="calibre_link-1746"></span>
 from barter, the hallmark of primitive societies, to market exchanges mediated via money (initially understood as a metallic currency), a transition that was less the result of state intervention (a later thesis known as Chartalism) than the continuation of the natural progressive arc of commerce’s civilizing mission. Espoused and advanced by the Scottish Enlightenment, this influential account also explains why the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange never took center stage in the eighteenth century’s most canonic works of “economics,” which focused on the transition from barter to money and on the public debt more than on paper instruments of private credit.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1197" href="#calibre_link-1496" class="calibre6">140</a>
</sup>
 In Gerard Malynes’s widely read compilation of merchant customs and norms, for example, the appearance of metallic money (there dated to 300 BCE Rome) marked the momentous beginning of a new historical phase. The subsequent creation of “exchange by bills for moneys” was simply a response to the dual challenge of carrying precious metal and converting the huge variety of currencies that were then in circulation.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1198" href="#calibre_link-1497" class="calibre6">141</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Interest in the transition from barter to money has similarly preoccupied modern scholars, even if they have debunked the idea that barter ever existed as a primordial and self-contained historical stage, and has thus distracted their attention from the existence of contemporaneous debates on the origins of what were once the most sophisticated paper instruments of private credit, notably premium insurance and bills of exchange. What this scholarship has failed to note is that, for a great many early modern writers, and obviously for Montesquieu, it was the transition from metallic currencies to bills of exchange that inaugurated a new era in the history of European commercial society&mdash;a transition depicted in unconditionally positive terms by the French philosophe and in more sober tones by those who praised the virtues of bills of exchange but worried about their unfettered diffusion.</p>
<p class="indent">The significance attributed to the replacement of coins with bills of exchange predated the fictitious account penned by Cleirac. By the mid-sixteenth century, Italian and Spanish authors had outlined an enduring counternarrative of this shift: merchants’ industriousness, not the prodigious talents of one refugee group or another, had led to the creation of new instruments capable of transferring money across regions for the purpose of moving goods from where they were abundant to where they were scarce, thus multiplying the beneficial effects of trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1199" href="#calibre_link-966" class="calibre6">142</a>
</sup>
 In Germany possibly more than elsewhere, works of jurisprudence and merchant handbooks both adopted this naturalist thesis. A young German jurist wrote in 1646 that “the law of nations and necessity introduced exchange operations, which civil law confirmed and customs <span title="194" id="calibre_link-1735"></span>
 approved of.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1200" href="#calibre_link-1498" class="calibre6">143</a>
</sup>
 A German guide to commerce drew a parallel with biological reproduction: “The bill of exchange with its laws was born from commerce like a child from his mother.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1201" href="#calibre_link-1499" class="calibre6">144</a>
</sup>
 Recapitulating existing theories on the origins of marine insurance, a jurist and civic leader in Lübeck, a Hanseatic town with a long maritime and commercial tradition, noted that some believed it existed in Roman law under different names, while others dated it to the the fourteenth or fifteenth century.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1202" href="#calibre_link-1500" class="calibre6">145</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">A lively discussion about the process through which credit instruments emerged and developed was thus already underway when Cleirac entered it, but his influence on the debate remained conspicuous for a good 250 years. After the mid-seventeenth century, the majority of European authors who discussed the origins of bills of exchange or marine insurance mentioned medieval Jews as being among the possible candidates for these instruments’ inventors&mdash;whether the discussions sought to endorse that hypothesis, disprove it, or, most often, contemplate it alongside others. If early modern debates about the emergence of bills of exchange are our karstic landscape and the various theories about their origins are the aquatic streams, then Cleirac, Dupuis de la Serra, and Montesquieu can be seen as headwaters, because each of them put forward a strong theory with which others contended. But because of the mysteries of karstic connections, we also need to pay attention to the multiple and intersecting streams that molded a landscape that in the eighteenth century became more trafficked and intricate.</p>
<p class="indent">The multiplication of printed works, including serial publications such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, occurred at a time of weak standards for plagiarism and paved the way for the propagation of a trope that sometimes appeared as little more than a casual reference. All in all, authorial credibility was paramount in the dissemination of ideas, and few authors were seen as so authoritative as Montesquieu. His was indeed the most consistent stream through which the legend infiltrated different corners of Europe. The Scottish Jacobite exile to France James Steuart, the German Cameralist Bielfeld (who wrote in French), the son of a leading Huguenot pastor living in Berlin Louis de Beausobre (1730&ndash;1783), and the Milanese professor of political economy Cesare Beccaria (whose disquisition on the subject appeared simultaneously in Italian, French, and English) did more than any others to embed the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange in a progressive narrative of European commercial society inspired directly by Montesquieu. Like their muse, they were less concerned with the history of Jews than with the allegorical power of the episode.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="195" id="calibre_link-1669"></span>
 Not everyone agrees with me on this point. Beausobre included the fictional narrative of the invention of bills of exchange at the hands of medieval Jews fleeing France in his treatment of the history of banking.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1203" href="#calibre_link-1501" class="calibre6">146</a>
</sup>
 Miriam Yardeni takes him literally and, ignoring the derivation of his passage, interprets it as “a factual report, devoid of ethical considerations of persecution as such.” Instead of viewing his account of Jews’ financial talent as a tale with a long past, she considers it exemplary of a growing tendency among second-generation Huguenot exiles, particularly those in Berlin, who had not experienced persecution firsthand, to be “more level-headed and perhaps more objective” with regard to Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1204" href="#calibre_link-1502" class="calibre6">147</a>
</sup>
 From everything I have said thus far, it is clear that the legend relayed by Beausobre hardly warrants this literal interpretation. There is no doubt that Huguenot exiles such as Pierre Bayle (1647&ndash;1706) and Henri (1615&ndash;1710) and Jacques (1653&ndash;1723) Basnage de Beauval advanced the cause of religious toleration more than most in their time, but neither their work nor Montesquieu’s portrayal of Jews as the engines of commercial society qualify as examples of objective inquiry.</p>
<p class="indent">The legend’s formulations clearly did not reflect the local conditions of Jewish life mimetically, even when they adapted and incorporated local themes. Overall, I do not detect an increasingly dispassionate ethnographic style in the treatment of Jews in merchant handbooks and commercial literature, in contrast to other genres of Christian writing about Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1205" href="#calibre_link-1503" class="calibre6">148</a>
</sup>
 In fact, the most serious blows to the historical account on which the legend rested came from French, German, and Italian authors writing in contexts in which Jews were less accepted and were inspired by either regional pride or antiquarian tendencies rather than by any desire to right the record regarding Jewish history. Meanwhile, the legend continued to appear in those contexts in which the place of commerce in national politics and the status of merchants in the social hierarchy remained contested. As its association with bills of exchange evolved to include other financial instruments, the view of Jews as shady manipulators of the stock market solidified even in those places where the degrees of religious toleration were highest&mdash;Amsterdam and London (although admittedly England was a distant second best to Amsterdam for Jews in the eighteenth century).</p>
<p class="indent">Generations of historians, anthropologists, and literary critics have demonstrated the importance of understanding tales that once held sway over people’s imagination because they disclose forgotten cultural models and their demise. By the close of the eighteenth century, the treatment of the origins of the credit instruments that had propelled European finance to new levels of <span title="196" id="calibre_link-1887"></span>
 sophistication was evidence of an enduring dilemma in academic scholarship. Two competing logics&mdash;the dogma of Jewish guile and the rise of positivist historical methods&mdash;played themselves out as scholars contended with multiple accounts of Europe’s capitalist modernity and the place of Jews in those accounts. As we will see, the tale of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange became a lightning rod in rival narratives of the so-called Rise of the West in the early days of modern European academia.</p>

<span class="small1">THE HABIT OF ATTRIBUTING</span>
 to Jews the invention of bills of exchange reached its zenith in the nineteenth century and percolated into an ever-broader variety of literary and scholarly genres. It left more than a trace in Victorian novels, which often portrayed Jews as usurers and callous social climbers, as the epigraph from Charles Dickens’s <em class="calibre4">David Copperfield</em>

 The possible Jewish origin of European financial instruments was mentioned even more frequently in countless works on maritime and commercial law, bills of exchange and marine insurance, and currency and paper money&mdash;a booming literature that encompassed historical studies of the evolution of private contracts for use in long-distance trade and legal treatises designed to clarify the nature of these contracts for either pedagogical purposes or domestic and international codification projects.

</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="198" id="calibre_link-1799"></span>
 In closing, I will depart from my penchant for lesser figures and focus instead on three giants of modern social thought: Karl Marx (1818&ndash;1883), Max Weber (1864&ndash;1920), and Werner Sombart (1863&ndash;1941). In their efforts to define what constituted <em class="calibre4">modern</em>
 capitalism and how it came into being, each proposed a different role for Jews. Although only Sombart transformed Jews into key actors in the genesis of Western capitalism, all three thinkers appealed to Jews to define how modern capitalism differed from earlier forms of commercialization. As part of this quest, Sombart proposed yet another version of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange, which figured front and center in his <em class="calibre4">Die Juden und das Wirtschaftsleben</em>
 (<em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 ), a text that most economic historians justly dismiss but that has exerted an enormous, troubling, and&mdash;as of late&mdash;contradictory influence on the field of Jewish history.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1211" href="#calibre_link-1909" class="calibre6">6</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">My treatment of these complex authors bears directly on the three broad themes that I identified in the introduction and have addressed throughout the book. The first is the question of what constitutes a canonical work in the history of economic thought and how those works shaped European ideas about the birth of capitalism. The previous chapters have demonstrated that Étienne Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 (1647), now almost completely forgotten, once represented a crucial point of reference that spun the legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange in myriad directions. A short piece on the economic role of Jews in medieval Europe published in 1875 by Wilhelm Roscher (1817&ndash;1894) met a similar fate: although today only a few specialists know it, the theory it advanced became canonical in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. One simply cannot understand Sombart’s views of Jews and capitalism without reference to Roscher’s.</p>
<p class="indent">A deeper link than their relative obscurity connects Cleirac to Roscher. In light of the analysis of the place of Jews in the economic literature that I have conducted this far, Marx, Roscher, and Sombart appear as the heirs of, or at least as profoundly influenced by, early modern economic debates. From that previous era they inherited both their familiarity with the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange and their tendency to stress the “Jewishness” of early capitalism. Weber broke with this tendency and inaugurated the process of the Christianization of capitalism that became dominant in the twentieth century. By the interwar period, leading medievalists of all persuasions&mdash; Marxists and non-Marxists, some more indebted to Weber than others, many <span title="199" id="calibre_link-1711"></span>
 (but not all) Catholics, and a few flirting with fascism&mdash;reacted against the then-emergent consensus that relegated the Middle Ages to a precapitalist phase of European civilization. These scholars reaffirmed the importance of late medieval economic growth in several ways, simultaneously rejecting the significance their predecessors attributed to medieval Jews in the making of modern capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">This observation feeds into my second concern, which is with periodization, and specifically with competing views of the way in which the transition from the medieval period to (early) modernity unfolded. The historical narrative of the supposed invention and dissemination of bills of exchange relayed by Cleirac implied a continuity between the medieval expulsions of French Jews and the seventeenth-century primacy of Amsterdam as a financial center. In both contexts Christian finance was seen as tainted by its Jewish origins. By contrast, Montesquieu’s refashioning of the legend presumed a sharp break between a medieval period during which the despised activities of trade and moneylending were understood as the prerogatives of Jews and a new phase in European history, located around the time of the transoceanic voyages by Columbus and Vasco da Gama, when the church retreated from the influential position it held in politics and society and commerce gained both independence from rulers’ arbitrary power and respectability.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the social theorists whose work I examine here never mentioned Montesquieu, they replicated his view of the Middle Ages as a time of economic autarky and of the sixteenth century as the beginning of the triumph of commerce as a superior civilizational stage. For all their differences, Marx, Sombart, and Weber agreed that the European economy during the Middle Ages did not meet their respective definitions of modern capitalism (even if Weber’s early work on medieval trade and urban society should lead us to qualify this statement). Different in temperament, political views, and scholarly approaches, all three thinkers experienced the epochal changes of rapid industrialization, mass migration to cities, and the consumerism and pauperism that accompanied these phenomena. The scale and pace of these upheavals were enormous and impressed academics, writers, and artists alike. Most scholars stressed what was new in modern capitalism&mdash;whether to praise or to demonize it&mdash;more than they dwelled on long-term continuities. The search for origins was part and parcel of this emphasis on ruptures.</p>
<p class="indent">Sombart parted ways with the general trend among both Christian and Jewish scholars by focusing not on medieval moneylenders but on Jewish <span title="200" id="calibre_link-1781"></span>
 merchants of the sixteenth century, and those of Iberian descent in particular. In keeping with his focus on the Western Sephardic diaspora, he provided a new iteration and date for the supposed Jewish invention not of bills of exchange <em class="calibre4">tout court</em>
 , but of endorsable bills, which had come to circulate more widely because they passed from one holder to the next (<a href="#calibre_link-99" class="calibre6">chapter 1</a>
 ). Sombart turned that Jewish invention into a cornerstone of his narrative about the nexus between Jews and modern capitalism. His portrayal of the international webs of Sephardic trade and finance, however, was not a tribute to Jews’ ability to integrate into a diverse commercial society and contribute to its expansion. Instead, his account mixed an outsized celebration of Sephardic commerce with a conservative disdain for capitalism that went beyond the nostalgia of widespread antimodernist positions. Read against the turn toward ethno-nationalism and the social strife of Wilhelmine Germany, his argument about Jews and captialism contained a more menacing message.</p>
<p class="indent">This point leads me to the last major issue with which I have been wrestling throughout this book: the relationship between the discursive representations of Jews and commerce by various authors on the one hand and the immediate historical circumstances in which those representations took shape on the other. I started by describing in detail the financial mechanisms underpinning bills of exchange and marine insurance in order to reveal the precise mixture of admiration and backlash that these instruments engendered when they were still relatively new (<a href="#calibre_link-99" class="calibre6">chapters 1</a>
 &ndash;<a href="#calibre_link-4" class="calibre6">3</a>
 ). I then situated the emergence and evolution of the tale attributing to Jews the invention of bills of exchange in relation to the social and political tensions that characterized Old Regime France, through the Revolution and beyond (<a href="#calibre_link-30" class="calibre6">chapters 4</a>
 &ndash;<a href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre6">6</a>
 ). Similarly, in mapping the legend’s diffusion across Europe from the mid-seventeenth to late eighteenth centuries, I examined the intellectual and material environments in which that tale was received, challenged, or rejected (<a href="#calibre_link-137" class="calibre6">chapter 7</a>
 ). I cannot provide an equally granular description of the historical contexts in which the grand theories we have inherited from Marx, Sombart, and Weber came into being, but I will hint at the extent to which contemporary events, including rising nationalism and authoritarianism, the politics of antisemitism, racial theories, and Zionism, mapped onto scholarly pursuits concerning the history and definition of modern capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">Emancipation is commonly recognized as the dividing line between the period we have examined up to this point and the historical backdrop to this chapter. In each European country, emancipation during the nineteenth century <span title="201" id="calibre_link-1730"></span>
 was a process rather than an event. During Marx’s youth, the legal equality of Jewish men in Prussia was still a matter of dispute. Between 1867 and 1871, however, most restrictions on Jews’ rights to residence, professional practice, and real estate ownership were lifted, at least on paper, across the German Empire. In other words, by the time Weber and Sombart wrote about Jews, the legal equality of male Jewish citizens had been inscribed into law. This legal revolution was a major stepping-stone toward a more equal society. Curiously, while it marked a profound break from the social and political structures of the Old Regime, emancipation also prolonged and transformed anxieties that had once been associated with a diametrically opposed measure, namely, forced baptism. The majority-Christian population feared that recent converts and newly emancipated Jews, although formally embracing the rules of their new fellowship, harbored a secret desire (as well as the power) to undermine the community that they had joined. The fear that former Jews continued to adhere to their ancient beliefs and allegiances after being baptized had been particularly acute in those regions of early modern Europe, including Iberia and southwestern France, where forced conversions were a fact of life. Under new guises, in those areas where emancipation erased most legal barriers between Jews and Christians, the view of Jewish citizens as a “fifth column” fueled new theories about the proper place that Jews should be assigned in delineating the historical trajectory of Western civilization.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2078">Marx, Sombart, and Weber</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the fall of 1843, at age twenty-five, Marx penned a review of two pieces on the so-called Jewish question that the atheist theologian and radical Young Hegelian Bruno Bauer had just published. In so doing, he joined a lively public debate on the subject. Bauer had challenged the Prussian Liberal Party, which demanded legal parity for Jews, by arguing that as long as Prussia remained a Christian state, Jews would always be second-class citizens, even if they were relieved of all legal disabilities. In support of his argument, Bauer had pointed to the French example: there, citizenship rights had not helped Jews improve their general conditions after 1790&ndash;1791, and in any case, religious discrimination had not been eradicated.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1212" href="#calibre_link-1910" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
 Marx agreed on this point but went further. For him, the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen equated “the rights of man” with political rights, said nothing about social rights, and merely ushered in a new property regime from which all other rights derived. <span title="202" id="calibre_link-1871"></span>
 “The practical application of the right of man to freedom is the right of man to <em class="calibre4">private property</em>
 ,” he wrote. “Therefore, not one of the so-called rights of man goes beyond the egotistic man, . . . namely an individual withdrawn into himself, his private interest and his private desires and separated from the community.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1213" href="#calibre_link-1911" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Read alongside his “Critique of Hegel’s Doctrine of the State,” completed just a month or two earlier, “On the Jewish Question” (1844) was an early articulation of Marx’s conception of private property as the fundamental logic that animates modern civil society. By focusing on the so-called Jewish question, it elaborated a “criticism of the political state” and tackled the “relationship of political emancipation to human emancipation.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1214" href="#calibre_link-1912" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
 Even a fully secular (i.e., non-Christian) republican state, Marx reasoned, could not protect its citizens from the power of money. Even once property qualifications for voting were lifted, private property, occupation, and education would still define social relations. To counter these forces, Marx famously demanded not the political emancipation of Jews, but “the emancipation of society from Judaism,” in the sense of mankind’s emancipation “from haggling and from money.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1215" href="#calibre_link-1913" class="calibre6">10</a>

 Jews stood in for what Marx would later call “the cash nexus”; they represented the “anti-social element” that, he claimed, had by then reached its historical peak.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1216" href="#calibre_link-1914" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In Marx’s conception, Jews worshiped the bill of exchange; they did not invent it. The difference should not go unnoticed. By making Judaism a synecdoche of humanity (a humanity incessantly occupied by buying, selling, bartering, and hustling), Marx treaded waters all too familiar, identifying Jewish usury as an attribute of both Jews and non-Jews and accusing Christian merchants of behaving like Jews in order to denounce their crookedness. But Marx also departed from this trope in a remarkable way. Rather than identifying Jewishness as a marker of certain flawed individuals, groups, or economic techniques, he presented the Judaization of (Christian) society as a process that was now completed: “The practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian people,” he wrote&mdash;or, in other words, all “Christians have become Jews,” not only some of them.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1217" href="#calibre_link-1915" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">A quick comparison of Marx’s notion that greed had become an inescapable social condition affecting everyone with more traditional views of Jewish usury as depicted by Honoré de Balzac in those same years brings the difference between the two into relief. One of the Jewish characters in Balzac’s <em class="calibre4">La comédie humaine</em>
 , Gobseck, a “banknote man” (<em class="calibre4">homme-billet</em>
 ), is an aged and <span title="203" id="calibre_link-1674"></span>
 clever usurer born in Antwerp around 1740 and living in Paris during the Restoration. Gobseck is not without qualities, but he has little regard for his fellow human beings (“If humanity, if sociability were a religion, he could be considered an atheist,” Balzac wrote). Unlike Shylock, the anachronistic pawnbroker of sixteenth-century Venice, Gobseck speculates on bills of exchange (many signed by women, another sign of the lamentable expansion of commercial society). He also belongs to a conspiratorial clique:</p>
<p class="blockquote">There are a dozen of us here in Paris, all silent unknown kings, the arbiters of your destinies . . . we meet on certain days of the week at Café Thémis, by the Pont Neuf. There, we uncover the mysteries of finance. There is no fortune that can keep the truth from us; we know every family’s secrets. We keep a kind of black book where we track the most important bills issued and redeemed, drafts on the public credit system, on the bank, in trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1218" href="#calibre_link-1916" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In short, Balzac’s Jewish moneylender and sly financier lives on the margins of Christian society, whose resources he is ready to siphon off in collusion with other Jews. Not so Marx’s Jews: they were understood to represent society in its totality. That is why there was no room in Marx’s work for the narrative of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange as we have come to know it, because in whatever version, that tale implied an initial separation between, rather than a convergence of, Jews and Christians. Jews bequeathed to non-Jews a financial innovation, and only after they adopted that innovation did Christian merchants become either potential “Judaizers” (as per Cleirac) or individuals able to use those bills to rein in the despot (according to Montesquieu). For Marx, instead, all of Christian capitalist society was “Jewish” from the start. Bills of exchange were Jews’ only real god in the sense that they were everyone’s only real god.</p>
<p class="indent">Marx’s identification of Jews with capitalism did not raise eyebrows then as it did later, when his antisemitic imagery (“Money is the jealous god of Israel”; “The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant”) generated no shortage of puzzlement, mistrust, and even revulsion among his readers.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1219" href="#calibre_link-1917" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
 It is impossible to pinpoint a single source of influence on Marx’s choice of the injurious language of economic antisemitism as a tool of critique. That language permeated the contemporary political discourse of both the Left and the Right. His readings of Hegel and Feuerbach made Marx arguably better versed in Christian than Jewish thought. His biography, too, certainly played a part and has been used either to exculpate him or to depict <span title="204" id="calibre_link-1801"></span>
 him as a self-hating Jew who provided ammunition to the enemies of Jews for generations to come.</p>
<p class="indent">Born of Jewish parents, Marx was baptized shortly after his father and not long before his mother, while both his paternal grandfather and uncle were rabbis in his native Trier. He grew up a Lutheran, a member of the reformed German Evangelical Church, the confession of Prussian rulers, in the predominantly Catholic region of the Rhineland, just after Prussia wrested it from Napoleon in 1814. Trier, on the Moselle River, was less than fifty miles from Thionville, where in 1775 Pierre-Louis Lacretelle launched the first campaign for Jewish emancipation (<a href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre6">chapter 6</a>
 ). Ruled by France from 1795 to 1814, the left bank of the Rhine was the easternmost region to experience the Revolution’s repercussions: its largely impoverished Jewish population was emancipated, subjected to new restrictions under Napoleon, and perpetually resented by the no less disadvantaged Catholic majority that was often indebted to Jewish moneylenders. We can only speculate about the impact that these circumstances had on the young Marx.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1220" href="#calibre_link-1918" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 What is certain is that, unlike contemporary socialist antisemitic writings, chief among them Alphone Toussenel’s <em class="calibre4">Les juifs, rois de l’époque</em>
 (<em class="calibre4">The Jews, Kings of the Time</em>
 ), Marx’s work eschewed historical Jews and Judaism in favor of a metaphorical invocation of both.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1221" href="#calibre_link-1919" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">For reasons that Marx never elucidated, he soon relinquished the equation of Jews and capitalism.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1222" href="#calibre_link-1920" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
 In its place, he put history into the service of theory in order to outline the transition from feudalism to capitalism in Europe’s past, with a focus on England. His evolutionary conception of history was reminiscent of the Enlightenment’s stadial theory insofar as it regarded urbanization and foreign trade as the two engines of the transformation of what Adam Smith called “the age of agriculture” into the “age of commerce.” Yet Marx differed from Smith not only in his insistence on land as a source of primitive accumulation but also in his belief that “the age of commerce” was neither the pinnacle of civilization nor its endgame. Whereas for Smith, “commerce and manufactures gradually introduced order and good government, and with them, the liberty and security of individuals,” Marx believed that capitalism negates individuals’ freedom.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1223" href="#calibre_link-1921" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
 Adapting the Hegelian dialectic to his theories, he transcended the thesis and antithesis of feudalism and capitalism with a new synthesis: socialism. In both Smith and Marx, the historical chronology was hazy, but the sixteenth century was identified as the definite turning point. In the first volume of <em class="calibre4">Capital</em>
 , Marx maintained that “trading nations,” which included the Jews, “exist[ed] in the ancient world only in its interstices,” while <span title="205" id="calibre_link-1802"></span>
 “the modern history of capital dates from the creation in the 16th century of a world-embracing commerce and a world-embracing market.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1224" href="#calibre_link-1922" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Although Sombart and Weber rejected Marx’s materialist explanation for the rise of modern capitalism, they both retained his basic chronology dating the causal forces that unleashed capitalism to the sixteenth century. Weber focused on the Reformation and Sombart insisted on depicting the Middle Ages as precapitalist.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1225" href="#calibre_link-1923" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
 Jewish history played a role in both authors’ conceptualizations of modern capitalism&mdash;a famously central role in Sombart’s and as an important counterexample in Weber’s. In fact, while on the surface their respective interpretations of Jews’ economic roles throughout history appear antithetical, on closer scrutiny, they can be seen to share important traits.</p>
<p class="indent">Both Weber and Sombart absorbed Roscher’s portrait of the medieval economy, and Sombart took more than a cue from Roscher’s depiction of Jews as the driving force behind the development of Western capitalism. Often referred to as the father of the German Historical School, Roscher exerted enormous influence on German academia through his writings and his students, notably Gustav von Schmoller (1838&ndash;1917). In a landmark 1875 essay, he proposed a simple thesis: “Among the Germanic peoples the Jews were better treated during the earlier than the later Middle Ages” (with the Black Death as the rough cutoff date). For Roscher, in the earlier period, Jews were the only ones “carrying on a professional trade in goods”; for several centuries, they were thus “the commercial guardians of the young nations,” that is, of medieval Christian powers. “The Jewish persecutions of the later Middle Ages,” he continued, “are in large measure a product of trade jealousy.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1226" href="#calibre_link-1891" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">What made “the young nations” feel they could turn against their economic benefactors without committing suicide? Roscher explained that medieval Jews introduced three innovations, and once Christians learned to handle them, they were free to rid themselves of their teachers. These “three important steps of economic progress” devised by medieval Jews were “the introduction of interest on capital,” “the protection of the possessor of an object illegally alienated but taken into possession in good faith by the receiver” (e.g., the full negotiability of stolen cash, as long as the receiver was unaware of its illicit provenance), and “the invention of bills of exchange.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1227" href="#calibre_link-1924" class="calibre6">22</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">As was usual at the time, footnotes in Roscher’s article were sparse.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1228" href="#calibre_link-1925" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
 It is therefore impossible to trace exactly how the legend that first appeared in the pages of Cleirac’s <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 in 1647 made its way into this text of the last quarter of the nineteenth century. To be sure, Roscher’s interpretation of the alleged invention of bills of exchange by Jews was antithetical to <span title="206" id="calibre_link-1675"></span>
 Montesquieu’s and closer to Friedrich Christoph Jonathan Fischer’s rendition of the legend (<a href="#calibre_link-137" class="calibre6">chapter 7</a>
 ). While in <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 Christian nations were depicted as putting the Jewish invention to such good use that commerce bettered social and political relations for everyone, in Roscher’s account Christians’ appropriation of the same Jewish invention inspired “jealousy” toward those who devised it, leading to antisemitic hatred and persecution.</p>
<p class="indent">Sombart absorbed this lesson. As in Roscher’s essay, the association between Jews and bills of exchange figured prominently in his 1911 <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 . For modern capitalism to emerge, Sombart noted in a core chapter of the book, credit had to evolve “from being a personal matter into one of an impersonal relationship,” a historical evolution that occurred once stocks and securities became tradable and payments began to be made in banknotes. In all the stages that accompanied this development, he wrote, “the Jew was ever present with his creative genius.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1229" href="#calibre_link-1892" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 Through a series of distorted citations and ludicrous statements (often rhetorically phrased as inferences but meant as assertions), Sombart proceeded to enumerate instances in which Jews had been the protagonists of all Europe’s private and public financial innovations. His treatment of bills of exchange encapsulated the two horns of his argument: Jews brought capitalism to its mature form during the sixteenth century, but they had been merchants since antiquity and personified commerce throughout the ages. The reason for this long-term specialization in trade resided in Judaism itself, which Sombart described as having a contractual and legalistic conception of the relationship between humans and the divine, a conception that preceded Protestantism and was similarly congruent with the calculative logic of capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">By the time Sombart wrote <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 , a number of scholars, including the towering German specialist of commercial law Levin Goldschmidt (1828&ndash;1897), had rejected the possibility that Jews might have invented bills of exchange and argued instead that those bills were the product of a slow evolution of the legal and financial systems.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1230" href="#calibre_link-1926" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
 In a formulation typical of his reasoning, Sombart claimed that these scholars “do not render testimony strong enough for the statement that the Jews were <em class="calibre4">not</em>
 the inventors of bills” during the Middle Ages.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1231" href="#calibre_link-1927" class="calibre6">26</a>
</sup>
 His real subject, he added, was “the modern endorsable bill” rather than the simple four-party bill of medieval derivation. Noting that Goldschmidt had traced the origins of negotiable bills of exchange to sixteenth-century Venice and that a reference to bills in general was made in a petition addressed by Christian merchants to the Venetian Republic in 1550, when the government was discussing the possibility of expelling crypto-Jews <span title="207" id="calibre_link-1765"></span>
 from the city, Sombart concluded: “It is fairly certain that the use of circulating endorsable bills in Venice must have been first commenced by Jews.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1232" href="#calibre_link-1928" class="calibre6">27</a>
</sup>
 The logic exceeded the evidence in a way that was characteristic of the entire book’s argumentative style. A reviewer at the time derided the faulty syllogism underlying this logic: banking was highly developed in Venice; sixteenth-century Venice housed a sizable Jewish community; therefore, Jews invented banking.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1233" href="#calibre_link-1929" class="calibre6">28</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Sombart transplanted Roscher’s tale of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange from late medieval Europe to the sixteenth-century Adriatic, where those bills became negotiable&mdash;and thus emblems of the ultimate abstraction of modern capitalism&mdash;before migrating to Holland and across the Atlantic. Not even this inflated historical arc, however, satisfied him. Drawing on biblical and Talmudic citations that specialists immediately demonstrated to be spurious, Sombart went on to state that “modern credit instruments [derived] from Rabbinic law.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1234" href="#calibre_link-1930" class="calibre6">29</a>
</sup>
 His argument thus came full circle, fusing the image of the sixteenth-century Jewish capitalist with that of the Jew as the eternal merchant.</p>
<p class="indent">More preposterous than Roscher’s essay of 1875, <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 was also more heavily annotated. And more than Roscher, Sombart owed an immense debt to the then-nascent field of academic scholarship on the Jewish past, which he pillaged and distorted. Of the more than 500 bibliographical citations that appeared in its footnotes (in a book that contained 434 pages of text), 83 percent were published after 1850 and 70 percent after 1875 (appendix 7). The majority of these recent publications represented what was then a new phenomenon: the rapid increase in the number and quality of works of Jewish history written by Jewish authors. Sombart relied on Heinrich Graetz’s landmark multivolume <em class="calibre4">History of the Jews</em>
 more than on any other reference, citing it seventy times.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1235" href="#calibre_link-1931" class="calibre6">30</a>
</sup>
 The choice was not surprising: Graetz (1817&ndash;1891) was indisputably the most renowned Jewish historian of the nineteenth century. But it was also a curious choice, because Graetz, a religious traditionalist, had little to say about the economic life of past Jewish societies and, to the extent that he addressed the topic, emphasized Christian persecution as the cause of Jews’ specialization in moneylending and commerce. That was not Sombart’s view. <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 stipulated that the expulsions from Iberia in the 1490s catalyzed Jewish capitalist potential, whereas Graetz did not see any progress in the conditions of Jewish life after 1492, and certainly did not celebrate the expansion of Jewish commerce in the sixteenth-century Atlantic. Sombart thus treated Graetz as a repository of information that he could fit <span title="208" id="calibre_link-1712"></span>
 into his predetermined scheme. Contrary to anything Graetz would have advocated, he even argued that the “spirit of capitalism” had belonged to the Jews from the start. Espousing the specious notion that “for some twenty centuries the Jews have kept themselves ethnically pure,” Sombart affirmed that their “characteristics were constant” and that Jews had “devoted themselves to trade” throughout their history.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1236" href="#calibre_link-1932" class="calibre6">31</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The treatment of Graetz is telling of how Sombart used the sources he cited. Another of his favorite authors was Meyer Kayserling (1829&ndash;1905), a rabbi and prolific amateur historian who wrote with fervor on a great many topics, from Jewish women to Moses Mendelssohn, but turned his attention in particular to Iberian Jews. In Kayserling’s work Sombart encountered claims he subsequently made his: that the fortunes seized from Jews had financed Christopher Columbus’s Atlantic voyages and that forcibly converted Jews (“Marranos”) had flocked to the Americas, where they came to dominate trade.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1237" href="#calibre_link-1933" class="calibre6">32</a>
</sup>
 In the nineteenth century, cultivated German Jews admired the literary, aesthetic, and philosophical achievements of their ancestors in medieval Iberia, whom they regarded as antithetical to the inward-looking, uncultivated, Yiddish-speaking eastern European Jews who surrounded them. Kayserling’s work was part cause and part effect of this “allure of the Sephardic,” whose idealization of the harmonious relations among Jews, Christians, and Muslims in pre-1492 Iberia was a measure of elite German Jews’ desire to assimilate while retaining their identity.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1238" href="#calibre_link-1934" class="calibre6">33</a>
</sup>
 Sombart absorbed this cultural trend and turned it on its head: against the consensus that the Iberian “golden age” ended in 1492, he exalted sixteenth-century Sephardic Jews, a group scorned by Orthodox Jews for having converted (albeit under pressure) and thus unlikely heroes of Jewish history. His exaltation obviously was not meant to restore the greatness of Western Sephardim and in fact represented a distorting caricature of it.</p>
<p class="indent">No less telling of Sombart’s attitudes toward his sources is the list of those he did not credit or consult, omissions that cannot be attributed solely to the imprecise citation standards of the time. The list begins with Roscher, who was never mentioned in the book. If his theories were sufficiently known to be recognizable to contemporary readers, the same cannot be said for the Christian anti-Jewish polemicist Johann Andreas Eisenmenger (1654&ndash;1704), whom Sombart echoed without explicit acknowledgement.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1239" href="#calibre_link-1935" class="calibre6">34</a>
</sup>
 With no command of Hebrew, he can be excused for ignoring an intra-Jewish literature absorbed in debating matters of philanthropy and economic solidarity that would have clashed with his views.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1240" href="#calibre_link-1936" class="calibre6">35</a>
</sup>
 No linguistic barrier, however, separated him from credible Jewish scholarship in German and French that engaged with <span title="209" id="calibre_link-1676"></span>
 the economic roles of Jews but did not square with his conclusions; he either discounted this scholarship altogether or treated it as the source of minor details cited out of context.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1241" href="#calibre_link-1937" class="calibre6">36</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">At the very same time, Sombart cherry-picked from abundant midcentury Jewish scholarly and lay publications by liberal and assimilated rabbis and writers, notably Ludwig Philippson (1811&ndash;1889), who used “a decidedly triumphalist tone” to celebrate Jews’ successes in commerce in ways that resonated positively among segments of the German bourgeoisie.<sup class="calibre7">

 in 1911 met with strikingly different responses among the German Jewish public, ranging from outraged hostility to enthusiastic embrace. For the most part, liberal Jews were angered by the work, while committed Zionists rejoiced at Sombart’s portrait of the brave new economic man as Jewish.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1244" href="#calibre_link-1742" class="calibre6">39</a>
</sup>
 Speaking to a large Jewish audience, Eugene Fuchs, leader of the moderate Central Union of German Citizens of Jewish Faith (<em class="calibre4">Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens</em>
 ), which worked for the integration of Jews into German society, denounced Sombart as the most insidious type of antisemite: someone who mixed traditional elements of Jewish hatred with seemingly philosemitic praises. Not only did he fail to convince his audience, which included a group of zealous Zionists, but “the meeting, to Fuchs’ dismay, ended in near riot.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1245" href="#calibre_link-1940" class="calibre6">40</a>
</sup>
 Exceeding the expectations of his Jewish admirers, the following year, in 1912, Sombart published a short pamphlet titled <em class="calibre4">Die Zukunft der Juden</em>
 (<em class="calibre4">The Future of the Jews</em>
 ), which denied that Jews could assimilate but conceded that they formed a nation of their own&mdash;a claim well received by Zionist separatists.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1246" href="#calibre_link-1743" class="calibre6">41</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The reception among Jewish historians was more sober and more sobering. By and large, they were closer to Roscher than to Sombart in their emphasis on persecution as the chief explanation for Jews’ commercial specialization, but their framework could accommodate elements of Sombart’s thesis. Georg Caro (1867&ndash;1912) and Ignaz Schipper (1884&ndash;1943), the authors of two recent and authoritative large-scale histories of the Jews, paid more attention to the economy than did Graetz. Sombart, however, lifted from these surveys a mere couple of anecdotes to back up his claims and failed to engage with their arguments.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1247" href="#calibre_link-1889" class="calibre6">42</a>
</sup>
 It fell upon Jewish textual scholars, who were philologists more than historians, to tear apart the building blocks of Sombart’s account <span title="210" id="calibre_link-1677"></span>
 by demonstrating the inaccuracy of his biblical and Talmudic citations, beginning with those related to the alleged Jewish invention of bills of exchange, stocks, obligations, and banknotes.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1248" href="#calibre_link-1893" class="calibre6">43</a>
</sup>
 These damaging criticisms by Jewish textual scholars, however, did not forge a coherent alternative to the narratives offered by either Graetz or Sombart.</p>
<p class="indent">That kind of work only appeared later, inspired at least in part by Weber’s very different treatment of Jewish economic history. In his college thesis, completed under Goldschmidt’s supervision, Weber identified legal innovations that had promoted capitalism in the late medieval Italian communes.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1249" href="#calibre_link-1941" class="calibre6">44</a>
</sup>
 But he never focused on bills of exchange, whose Jewish origin Goldschmidt had contested.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1250" href="#calibre_link-1839" class="calibre6">45</a>
</sup>
 Weber also soon abandoned the study of Italian communes and is better remembered for the work that he produced in dialogue with Sombart.</p>
<p class="indent">It is well known that Sombart’s <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 was a response to Weber’s <em class="calibre4">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em>
 (1904&ndash;1905).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1251" href="#calibre_link-1942" class="calibre6">46</a>
</sup>
 Weber’s <em class="calibre4">Ancient Judaism</em>
 (1915&ndash;1919), in turn, was a response to Sombart’s <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 . In that work, as well as in the university lectures that he delivered the semester before his death in June 1920 and in the pages later collected in <em class="calibre4">Economy and Society</em>
 , Weber singled out Jews and Judaism as the opposites of modern capitalism and its spirit (as he defined it). He repeated Roscher’s thesis when he stated that “the first wave of anti-Semitism” at the time of the Crusades was “a symptom of the development of a national commercial class.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1252" href="#calibre_link-1943" class="calibre6">47</a>
</sup>
 But he thoroughly rejected the way in which Sombart had spun Roscher’s thesis and specifically the identification of Judaism with the ethics of capitalism. For Weber, Jews possessed loyalty only to other Jews and were thus unable to participate in impersonal market transactions. Introducing the notion of Jews as pariahs and their dual in-group/out-group morality, Weber spoke of Jews’ “voluntary ghetto” as predating “compulsory internment.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1253" href="#calibre_link-1944" class="calibre6">48</a>
</sup>
 He then concluded that “since antiquity, Jewish pariah capitalism . . . felt at home in the very forms of state-and booty-capitalism along with pure money usury and trade, precisely what Puritanism abhorred.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1254" href="#calibre_link-1945" class="calibre6">49</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Weber disagreed with Sombart on several other issues concerning the origins and achievements of Western capitalism. Given his greater textual meticulousness and his rejection of any affinity between Judaism and the spirit of modern capitalism, he made no reference to the alleged Jewish invention of bills of exchange, which both Roscher and Sombart had highlighted. That said, in spite of all the important differences between Weber’s and Sombart’s characterizations of past Jewish economic contributions, the two shared a conception of Judaism as a religion that favored self-segregation&mdash;a belief that allowed <span title="211" id="calibre_link-1791"></span>
 both of them to downplay persecution and to portray Judaism as exogenous to the arc of Western history. For Weber, modern capitalism was “<em class="calibre4">uniquely Occidental</em>
 ” and Judaism an “Oriental” religion.<sup class="calibre7">

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2079">The Revolt of the Medievalists</h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the unintended consequences of the heated debates spurred by Weber’s and Sombart’s rival interpretations of the causes of Europe’s economic ascent beginning in the sixteenth century was a call to arms by economic historians of the Middle Ages. The expression “the revolt of the medievalists” was coined by Wallace Ferguson in 1948 to describe the contributions of those scholars who, during the interwar period, had subverted Jacob Burckhardt’s legacy in the study of the Renaissance and proclaimed the twelfth century to be the foundational moment of European civilization.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1256" href="#calibre_link-1947" class="calibre6">51</a>
</sup>
 In fact, a parallel revolt of other medievalists, different from but not unrelated to the one Ferguson identified, had been underway since 1914, when the Belgian historian Henri Pirenne (1862&ndash;1935), objecting to both Sombart and Weber, wrote: “All the essential features of capitalism&mdash;individual enterprise, advances on credit, commercial profit, speculation, etc.&mdash;are to be found from the twelfth century on, in the city republics of Italy&mdash;Venice, Genoa, or Florence.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1257" href="#calibre_link-1948" class="calibre6">52</a>
</sup>
 Around the same time, the German Catholic liberal historian Lujo Brentano (1844&ndash;1931) not only belittled Sombart’s account but also maintained that the warlike mentality of feudalism and the church during the High Middle Ages were responsible for transforming commerce (which had not disappeared after the fall of Rome) into modern capitalism. In his words, “The beginning of modern capitalism does not date from the Fourth Crusade [1204]; had it not already developed long before, the Fourth Crusade would not have been thinkable.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1258" href="#calibre_link-1949" class="calibre6">53</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Far from being a mere quibble over periodization, the revolt of these medievalists had far-reaching consequences for twentieth-century scholarly debates about the so-called Rise of the West. Until the 1970s, the alternative chronology it proposed for Europe’s economic takeoff had mainstream purchase. Moreover, the Middle Ages that the opponents of Weber and Sombart portrayed as the incubators of Western capitalism were thoroughly Christian; Catholic historians in particular detected in these societies a positive alliance between moral theologians and political elites, between Scholasticism and the ethics of merchant-bankers who were also civic leaders.</p>
<p class="indent">The economic historians of the interwar period who saw capitalism taking shape in the Middle Ages came from a wide political spectrum, but all relegated <span title="212" id="calibre_link-1838"></span>
 Jews to the margins of their inquiries, if they discussed them at all. In France, they included anti-Marxists like Henri Sée (1864&ndash;1936) and André-E. Sayous (1873&ndash;1940), as well as Marxists like Henri Hauser (1866&ndash;1946).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1259" href="#calibre_link-1950" class="calibre6">54</a>
</sup>
 In Italy, a legal-economic school anticipated the early revolt of the medievalists with pioneering studies of medieval commercial law, including several focusing on marine insurance and bills of exchange. Predictably, once they scrutinized archival records in Genoa, Venice, and other Italian medieval cities, these scholars, some of whom, notably Alessandro Lattes (1858&ndash;1940) and Arturo Segre (1873&ndash;1928), were Jewish, found no trace of a supposed Jewish invention of bills of exchange. More generally, they repudiated the idea that Jews had been key players in medieval international trade and finance.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1260" href="#calibre_link-1951" class="calibre6">55</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">A different group of Italian medievalists proved even more influential. Intent on stressing the compatibility of Christianity and capitalism, they denied Jews any role in the genesis of the latter. The two best-known of these scholars were Amintore Fanfani (1908&ndash;1999), who replaced the esteemed Jewish medievalist Gino Luzzatto (1878&ndash;1964) at the University of Venice while the Racial Laws of 1938 were in effect and served five times as Democratic Christian prime minister of the postwar Italian Republic, and Armando Sapori (1892&ndash;1976), a senator from the non-Communist Left and a scholar who wielded tremendous academic power from his position at the Università Luigi Bocconi in Milan. While Fanfani criticized Weber’s emphasis on Protestantism, Sapori took issue with Sombart. Both insisted that the origins of modern capitalism resided in the Italian medieval communes and were infused with Christian ethics and a sense of solidarity&mdash;a depiction designed to lessen the atomized character of early capitalism. In order to buttress their thesis, they pushed Jews to the fringes of medieval urban economies by portraying them as pawnbrokers rather than international traders. In a 1964 volume of reflections on Sombart’s wide-ranging work and its Italian reception that Fanfani edited, no mention was made of the <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1261" href="#calibre_link-1952" class="calibre6">56</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Medievalists led the way among British economic historians of the interwar period but they also sidelined the topic of Jewish economic activities, in part because their studies privileged agriculture over long-distance trade and in part because they focused on England, which had expelled Jews as early as 1290.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1262" href="#calibre_link-1953" class="calibre6">57</a>
</sup>
 Robert Sabatino Lopez (1910&ndash;1986), an Italian Jewish refugee to the United States, where he arrived soon after losing his university position in Genoa under Fascism, shared Pirenne’s interest in the revival of late medieval European cities.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1263" href="#calibre_link-1954" class="calibre6">58</a>
</sup>
 His many studies of Genoese and Mediterranean trade culminated in <em class="calibre4">The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 950&ndash;1350</em>
 (1971), <span title="213" id="calibre_link-1803"></span>
 which made the most powerful statement to date about the direct descent of modern capitalism from its medieval predecessor: “And if medieval growth was not fast, it was altogether irreversible; it created the indispensable material and moral conditions for a thousand years of virtually uninterrupted growth; and, in more than one way, it is still with us.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1264" href="#calibre_link-1955" class="calibre6">59</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The book included a brief section on “the Jews,” which described them as the only group that from the ninth to the early eleventh centuries was “left to provide a link, however tenuous, between Catholic Europe and the more advanced countries beyond it: the Islamic world, the Byzantine Empire, even India and China”; in Europe, too, Lopez added, “for certain villages, the resident or transient Jews represented the only window open onto the world.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1265" href="#calibre_link-1956" class="calibre6">60</a>
</sup>
 But in Lopez’s overall narrative, the lead characters were the Italian merchants of the late Middle Ages. The Belgian accountant-turned-historian Raymond de Roover (1904&ndash;1972), who had coined the expression “commercial revolution of the Middle Ages,” concurred entirely.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1266" href="#calibre_link-1957" class="calibre6">61</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">After this fertile season of scholarship, research on medieval commercial contracts, including marine insurance and bills of exchange, and their evolution in the sixteenth century retreated into a corner of the academy. Today, the most influential narratives about Europe’s takeoff focus on the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the leading causes to which various scholars attribute the primacy of Europe over Asia (public finance and representative institutions, colonialism and slavery, high wages and technological innovation) do not include the fruits of the medieval commercial revolution, for reasons I will return to in the coda.<sup class="calibre7">

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-2080">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">That the founders of modern social theory were well acquainted with the legend of the Jewish origin of bills of exchange&mdash;and that some of them embraced it outright&mdash;should be cause for reflection. By the late eighteenth century, the notion that medieval Jews might have been responsible for devising key European financial instruments had come under increasing scrutiny for its evidentiary fallacies and inconsistent storyline. One might well have expected the rise of academic scholarship in the nineteenth century to seal the fate of the legend. To the contrary, the improbable tale experienced a rich afterlife in the age of positivism. In spite of attempts to set the record straight, <span title="214" id="calibre_link-1865"></span>
 notably Goldschmit’s authoritative study of commercial law, the account attributing to Jews the invention of bills of exchange entered a new phase when, in 1875, Roscher transformed that moral tale into a pseudo-fact. He did so without invoking any source, as if the notion that Jews invented bills of exchange needed no corroboration, wiping out nearly two centuries of debate over the meaning and plausibility of Cleirac’s tale of origins. Ultimately, Roscher turned a fantasy about the past into a legitimate and commanding academic statement, which, in Sombart’s hands, fueled new fantasies.</p>
<p class="indent">And insidious fantasies they were. Today it is common practice to take Weber to task for his Orientalist distortions, which led him to portray all premodern Islamic societies as lacking both entrepreneurship and robust political institutions. But when measured against the available secondary literature and the prevailing standards of source criticism of the time, Sombart’s scholarly practice must be judged to be far shoddier than Weber’s. And yet there has been a recent revival of interest in his thesis about Jews and capitalism, as if its more damaging and problematic implications could be set aside (coda).</p>
<p class="indent">More than the veracity of the legend itself, the place of Jews in the historical arc of Western modernity became the subject of intense debate throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During this period bills of exchange were still ordinary modes of payment, especially in international trade, and most of the scholars discussed in this chapter no doubt had direct or indirect knowledge of how they worked. But with the second industrial revolution underway, new economic and financial institutions, including factories, deposit banks, the corporation, and the stock market (rather than bills of exchange), became the focus of contemporary discussions of the productive and destructive forces of modern capitalism. The legend thus ceased to be a compass of the morality of credit, as it had been in the Old Regime, but entered the academic grand narratives about the emergence of Western capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">Different definitions of capitalism and different evaluations of the historical trajectories leading to it meant that Jews were assigned different positions in these grand narratives. For the young Marx, Jews and Judaism did not represent a stage in capitalist development but rather personified modern capitalism <em class="calibre4">tout court</em>
 . By contrast, Weber was not only more interested in capitalism than in Jews, but also intent on salvaging what was good in capitalism as a hallmark of Western civilization. With that intent, he purged his account of any Jewish traces, regarding Jews and Judaism as inferior and extraneous to that civilization. For Sombart, in contrast, capitalism bred moral decline, which is why it had a Jewish face.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="215" id="calibre_link-1800"></span>
 Sombart stood out in the increasingly crowded field of scholars debating “Jewish contributions to Western civilization” because he glorified not the achievements of medieval Iberian Jewries but the commercial and financial networks of those Jews who had been expelled or forced to convert in the 1490s. This shift of focus also meant that he treated all New Christians as crypto-Jews whose economic cunning was even more insidious than that of practicing Jews, because the true nature and genuine allegiances of those who possessed it were hard to discern. The inability to distinguish baptized Jews and their descendants from the rest of the population had rendered these individuals particularly suspicious in Old Regime Bordeaux, where they were suspected of paying only outward homage to their new religion while commanding significant economic influence and allying with hostile political forces. This blurring of the line dividing Jews from non-Jews remained the source of lingering reservations after Jews were granted political equality. At the turn of the twentieth century, so-called scientific racism, which promised to render Jews visible after they had become legally indistinguishable from their Christian peers, tainted all discussions of what bonded Jews together (regardless of whether or not one agrees that Sombart embraced a racial theory of Jews).</p>
<p class="indent">The medievalists who rebuffed the assertion that economic modernity started with the Jewish invention of bills of exchange agreed on one thing: Marx, Sombart, and Weber underestimated the many and lasting contributions that the Middle Ages made to the so-called Rise of the West. But the Middle Ages these scholars had inherited from previous generations was stained by accounts that posited oversized roles for Jewish usury. From the mid-seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, scores of writers had battled over the proper place of commerce, and Jewish commerce in particular, in European (i.e., Christian) societies. In their revolt, interwar medievalists pushed Jews to the margins of their investigations as a way of cleansing the stain that any associations of capitalism with Jews carried. In the process, they also contributed to pushing Jewish history out of the mainstream, consigning it to a subfield of academic inquiry into which few nonspecialists roam.</p>

<span class="small1">THIS BOOK BEGAN</span>
 with a chance encounter. A few lines in the best known of all seventeenth-century European merchant manuals jumped off the page because they made little sense to this modern reader. Over the years, curiosity and stubbornness prompted me to stay with these lines. In the end, I was able to document how a forgotten tale of the origins of European financial capitalism constituted conventional wisdom from the 1650s to the 1910s to such a degree that those who did not believe in it had to go out of their way to contest it.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout these 250 years, what I have called the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange absorbed and at the same time transformed conceptions of Jewish usury that had emerged in the thirteenth century. Resilient as those conceptions proved to be across time, they also evolved and adapted in response to new realities and competing discursive traditions. In fact, the legend analyzed here, as capacious and malleable as any other, served multiple, sometimes even conflicting, agendas. By mapping the routes of its transmission, I have shown why this tale became a powerful tool for debating and policing the boundaries of European commercial society and why it planted deeper roots in France than in the rest of Old Regime Europe. Finally, I have concluded with an excursus on the afterlife of the legend in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which has revealed how central to European economic history this narrative was until a century ago.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="217" id="calibre_link-1866"></span>
 One question remains: If the legend was as significant and widespread as I claim, why do we not know about it today? At the most basic level, its disappearance was to be expected: we no longer use bills of exchange, so we no longer worry about who invented them. Within the academy, however, the silence is less self-evident. The fact that the legend’s validity has been debunked does not explain its fall into oblivion. Origin stories continue to fascinate historians, anthropologists, and literary critics, less for the veracity of their content than for what they tell us about shared beliefs of societies different from ours. Scholars of humanism and early modern thought have documented the inexorable tendency of European chroniclers and historians to mix demonstrable facts, forgeries, and myths. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, more consistent protocols of authentication and verification of textual and material pieces of evidence emerged, but they continued to coexist alongside utterly unsubstantiated reconstructions of the past.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1270" href="#calibre_link-1990" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
 We thus remain interested in the so-called battle between the ancients and the moderns, whose competing claims about the value of imitation or originality responded to logics we no longer share; similarly, eighteenth-century projects of encyclopedic knowledge continue to intrigue us even if they fall short of modern evidentiary standards.</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, we pay little attention to the combination of fact and fiction that punctuates the literature written by and for merchants, for the simple reason that we tend to assign to this literature a pragmatic function even as we recognize that merchant ethics was not easily separable from religious morality or that political imperatives tilted recommendations in favor of one economic solution over another. The legend I have examined throughout this book relied on a mixture of selective memory (Christian authors knew little about the Jewish past) and sheer fabrication (Jews in late medieval France and Italy had nothing to do with the invention of bills of exchange). This mixture helped make the legend an allegory of the hopes and fears brought about by the expansion of credit relations between people near and far, relations that were deemed to be at once extraordinarily beneficial and threatening to the established social and political order.</p>
<p class="indent">The recent process of forgetting the legend in turn prompts us to review a number of trends, particularly pronounced in Anglophone scholarship, that have been underway within the academy over the past fifty years. I have already hinted at some of these trends when analyzing the disconnect between historians of the French Revolution and historians of Jewish emancipation in France: even when they examine the same events or the same authors (notably <span title="218" id="calibre_link-1715"></span>
 the Count of Mirabeau), they pass each other like ships in the night (<a href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre6">chapter 6</a>
 ). To evaluate more systematically the reasons for the amnesia that surrounds the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange is also to reflect on past and current modes of writing about European economic history, as I began to do at the end of the previous chapter, and to explain why my inquiry intersects with several fields, disciplines, and intellectual traditions and fits neatly into none.</p>
<p class="indent">Bills of exchange once held pride of place in economic and business history. In nineteenth-century German universities, economic history was taught in faculties of law. Legal and economic history were strongly linked in sectors of the French and Italian academies as well. From that perspective, bills of exchange were an ideal object of analysis: scholars disagreed sharply about the nature of the legal and financial arrangements that underpinned these bills and their historical evolution, but they all treated bills’ increasing complexity from the late medieval period to the seventeenth century as symptomatic of larger transformations in European history. No doubt an introduction to the history of bills of exchange was part of the training in economic history that Max Weber and Werner Sombart received. Both also absorbed the lessons of the German Historical School, which pitted historical specificity, and particularly the nexus between cultural, legal, and economic norms, against the emerging formalism of the Austrian School and the laissez-faire dogmatism of the Manchester School. In retrospect, the founders of German social theory appear overly bent on describing historical change as a series of progressive stages of development and civilizational blocks, but we ought to appreciate their precocious interest in the legal framework of economic organization, an interest that today is once again at the heart of the social sciences.</p>
<p class="indent">In the mid-twentieth century, business history was still integral to the study of the Renaissance. If the Renaissance was the cradle of modernity, many scholars asked, what role did the development of financial instruments play in that story? And if individualism was an essential trait of modernity, which economic institutions most fostered it? In mining volumes of business correspondence and the bookkeeping registers of Italian merchants, both ordinary and exceptional (the Medici Bank being among the latter), Raymond de Roover devoted particular attention to bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1271" href="#calibre_link-1991" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
 Few followed in his footsteps, and even fewer matched his ability to paint a broad canvas using minute reconstructions of early banking techniques and intricate theological diatribes about usury and just price. In the meantime, the center of gravity in the economic history of preindustrial Europe began to move away from southern <span title="219" id="calibre_link-1797"></span>
 Europe and further along in time. In the process, the sixteenth century slipped under economic historians’ radar, and with it, the golden age of bills of exchange and financial fairs.</p>
<p class="indent">In North America in the past fifty years, economic history has migrated from history to economics departments (although recently this trend has been partially reversed). Among economists, economic historians are a minority, and those interested in preindustrial Europe are an even tinier group. Large-scale datasets suitable for statistical treatment are a near-requirement in the discipline but are harder to come by or to construct for earlier periods. To the extent that the military and fiscal expansion of Europe in the sixteenth century remains a subject of inquiry, it is studied via secondary sources. For the brave few who still venture into the archives, the pressure to identify antecedents to present-day financial institutions means that the public debt and stock markets of northern Europe are better-trodden paths of scholarship than bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1272" href="#calibre_link-1992" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, social scientists’ propensity to measure economic indicators such as wages, stock prices, and tax revenues has been coupled with a renewed interest in culture as a causal motor of change. In some areas, notably the study of technological innovation, that interest had never faded. But in others, the affirmation of rational choice theory as the dominant interpretative paradigm in the social sciences had expunged culture from the list of variables to be taken into consideration when analyzing the causes of past economic growth and decline. Even as interest in cultural determinants resurfaces, however, disciplinary and methodological balkanization between humanistic and social scientific research persists and has even created new chasms in the very terrain where one could in principle expect greater collaboration. Economists and political scientists are comfortable with a static notion of cultural blocks (e.g., Europe vs. China, Latin Europe vs. the Islamic world, Catholics vs. Protestants) that is anathema to historians and tend to emphasize persistence rather than change over time.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1273" href="#calibre_link-1993" class="calibre6">5</a>
</sup>
 Naturally, this is not the type of scholarship that would call attention to a seemingly idiosyncratic narrative like the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">The history of economic thought has experienced its own mutations and in the process has sidelined the kind of questions that would lead us to pay attention to a legend like this. With a few exceptions, found mostly in Marxist-leaning citadels, the history of economic thought is no longer part of the mandatory curricula of economics doctoral programs and is taught in only a handful of history departments in North America. The marginalization of the field <span title="220" id="calibre_link-1728"></span>
 has had some refreshing effects, including the broadening of the range of texts and authors that now come under its purview. All in all, however, this rejuvenation has not affected all areas of inquiry equally: the Middle Ages and the sixteenth century have largely been relegated to the periphery, while the Enlightenment and eighteenth-century political economy have come to occupy center stage. The impetus for this resurgence of interest owes a great deal to influential works of the Cambridge School. Yet these works give primacy to politics over the economy, and consequently, the focus has shifted to public finance or the balance of trade at the expense of credit instruments that wove together the everyday lives of ordinary people and private entrepreneurs.<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">Because moral theologians and canon lawyers who debated usury were also among the major economic theorists before 1600, the thinning of scholarly work on the economic history and history of economic thought of that period during the second half of the twentieth century has meant fewer opportunities for mainstream historians of early modern Europe to encounter scholarship on Christian debates about Jews and usury. Meanwhile, the growing affirmation of Jewish history as a legitimate academic subject with its own separate institutional infrastructure, a phenomenon seen especially in North America, has tended to widen rather than narrow the gap between its practitioners and historians of Europe. Admittedly, one can count on one’s hand the early modern Jewish authors, such as the Amsterdam merchant-turned-philosophe Isaac de Pinto, who engaged in conversation with non-Jewish writers regarding the place of commerce in politics and society. But the elision of Jewish topics from the history of early modern European economic thought and economic history is first and foremost the result of the segmentation of academic fields&mdash; a tendency this book has sought to combat.</p>
<p class="indent">A bit more needs to be said about both the fate of economic history and the fate of the legend itself among scholars of European Jewry. To start, we ought to recognize that economic history has long had a mixed reputation among Jewish scholars. The first grand narrative of Jewish history to displace the primacy of religion and foreground a sociological approach was the work of the Russian Jewish scholar and advocate Simon Dubnow (1860&ndash;1941).<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1275" href="#calibre_link-1995" class="calibre6">7</a>
</sup>
 In the interwar period, the doyen of twentieth-century Jewish historians, Salo W. Baron (1895&ndash;1989), completed the first version of his massive and massively influential history of the Jews from antiquity to the modern age. Titled <em class="calibre4">A Social and Religious History of the Jews</em>
 , it devoted limited space to economic phenomena.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1276" href="#calibre_link-1996" class="calibre6">8</a>
</sup>
 In 1942, Baron called for a “dispassionate examination of the historic relationships between modern capitalism and the Jews,” yet his own broad <span title="221" id="calibre_link-1635"></span>
 sketch was more intent on stressing the detrimental effects of “individualism and materialism” on Jewish tradition than on producing the kind of “dispassionate examination” he advocated.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1277" href="#calibre_link-1997" class="calibre6">9</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">In the aftermath of World War II, few were ready to pick up Baron’s undertaking where he had left it. The prominence of economic themes in the murderous persecutions of Jews carried out by totalitarian regimes in the mid-twentieth century made most Jewish scholars wary of delving into the subject. A general discomfort surrounded the scholarly treatment of all economic activities by Jews, and the commercial roles Jews played in premodern Europe in particular.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1278" href="#calibre_link-1998" class="calibre6">10</a>
</sup>
 As a result, the four decades after the Holocaust were not a period of innovation in the field of Jewish economic history. To the extent that Zionist historians were interested in the topic, they turned to agriculture and industrialization as the two defining phenomena of past and modern Jewish societies. The standard narrative remained the same: only under the mounting pressure of persecution after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE had Jews flocked to commerce, an activity in which they came to excel not because of innate characteristics but because of a lack of alternative opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">This was the consensus that Jewish historians took for granted when they wrestled with the possibility that Jews might have invented bills of exchange, a claim that cut both ways: it valorized Jews’ resilience in the face of inauspicious external circumstances, but it also risked casting them as perennial and omnipotent merchants. At the turn of the twentieth century, <em class="calibre4">The Jewish Encyclopedia</em>
 , the English-language monument to the recent achievements of Jewish scholarship, relayed the views of those who ascribed to Jews the invention of bills of exchange, but it gave more credence to the idea that Muslim traders devised these financial instruments in the eighth century and that Italian merchants later perfected them.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1279" href="#calibre_link-1999" class="calibre6">11</a>
</sup>
 In the 1930s, Baron had no doubt that “the vital innovations of paper currency, international bills of exchange, the stock exchange, etc., reveal little, if any, Jewish influence in their early stages.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1280" href="#calibre_link-2000" class="calibre6">12</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The authoritativeness of Baron’s statement did not mean that lay and academic Jewish audiences ceased to come across the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange. In a pioneering history of the Jews of his native Thessaloniki, Isaac Samuel Emmanuel (1896&ndash;1972), a German-educated historian and ordained rabbi, connected the tale with his ancestors: in his telling, bills of exchange had been invented by Jews fleeing Spain in 1492, who hid those pieces of paper in their prayer books and were thus able to save a great deal of their assets.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1281" href="#calibre_link-2001" class="calibre6">13</a>
</sup>
 With Sephardic Jews still occupying a marginal position in <span title="222" id="calibre_link-1627"></span>
 Jewish academic institutions, this further elaboration of the legend did not gain traction.</p>
<p class="indent">It was Montesquieu’s version of the legend that enlisted the most supporters and detractors. In a fast-paced lecture in London on the emancipation of European Jewry and the rise of capitalism, the renowned book collector, scholar, and polymath Chimen Abramsky (1916&ndash;2010) took the time to debunk Montesquieu’s idea and explain instead that “Lombard merchants and bankers” had introduced bills of exchange.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1282" href="#calibre_link-2002" class="calibre6">14</a>
</sup>
 When Shmuel Ettinger (1919&ndash;1988), a lapsed communist and secular Zionist professor of history at Hebrew University, painted the economic history of Jews in broad strokes in a brief essay, he greatly downplayed the link between commerce and emancipation, but even he could not resist relaying Montesquieu’s exaltation of Jews’ financial skills as rare praise amid the generally unsympathetic Enlightenment treatment of the Jews.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1283" href="#calibre_link-2003" class="calibre6">15</a>
</sup>
 Ettinger was not the only faculty member in Jerusalem who incorporated the legend into his teaching and writing. In the 1960s, a student at Hebrew University could still be taught that medieval Jews invented bills of exchange as part of the narrative that celebrated Jews’ outstanding commercial skills as a form of survival in adverse circumstances.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1284" href="#calibre_link-2004" class="calibre6">16</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">It took an outsider to shatter the historiographical consensus. In his <em class="calibre4">European Jewry in the Age of Mercantalism, 1550&ndash;1750</em>
 , first published in 1985, Jonathan Israel focuses on Sombart’s post-1492 chronology but rejects his framework entirely by attributing the reversal of the fortunes of both eastern and western European Jews in the period between 1550 and 1713 to the “political and spiritual upheaval which engulfed European culture as a whole at the end of the sixteenth century.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1285" href="#calibre_link-2005" class="calibre6">17</a>
</sup>
 Israel’s wide-ranging synthesis aims to show that a singular convergence of the doctrines of toleration that emerged from the French Wars of Religion, the surge of interest in the Hebrew Bible among Christian scholars, and new economic policies designed to attract Jews and other foreign merchants to Christian communities in order to boost commerce favored Jews’ reintegration into parts of Europe from which they had been expelled in the Middle Ages. Not any inherent facility with money, but a tendency to adapt to local structures they could not control led Jews to take up different economic roles in different regions of the Continent: in western Europe, Sephardim seized opportunities created by sweeping maritime empires; in central Europe, a few wealthy financiers negotiated privileges for fellow Jews in exchange for providing princes with the resources and services they needed to fund their war efforts; in the Polish&ndash;Lithuanian Commonwealth, absentee feudal lords relied on Jews to tend to their estates. When <span title="223" id="calibre_link-1636"></span>
 political and economic conditions in each region changed, so did the economic profile of the Jews there.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Israel does not discuss the commercial techniques utilized by Jewish merchants and brokers, he implies that these individuals conformed to the forms of business organization that prevailed in the surrounding societies. Obviously, there is no place in his approach for the legend or any other special ties between Jews and bills of exchange. Nor does he feel the need to mention Sombart. His goal is to weave Jewish history into the fabric of European history, not to confine it to a separate sphere. In Israel’s perspective, the singularities of the Jewish experience serve to illuminate broader dynamics that affected early modern Europe at large and offer grounds for further comparisons more than they are significant in and of themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">This disregard for Sombart, however, has been far from universal. At the turn of the twenty-first century, the old discomfort toward economic history has given way to a spike in interest in the subject among historians of past Jewish societies.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1286" href="#calibre_link-2006" class="calibre6">18</a>
</sup>
 And with it, Sombart has been resurrected, alternatively as the dead horse that still needs beating or as a hidden muse. Breaking the usual reticence that many display in broaching the subject of Jews and capitalism, some scholars today justify their approach in relation to Sombart, and others even find redeeming qualities in his work. Yuri Slezkine joins a long line of thinkers for whom “the Jews epitomize Western civilization&mdash;as its original creators, best practitioners, and rightful beneficiaries.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1287" href="#calibre_link-2007" class="calibre6">19</a>
</sup>
 At the same time, for fear that these assertions might be misconstrued, he distances himself from Sombart.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1288" href="#calibre_link-2008" class="calibre6">20</a>
</sup>
 In a prize-winning book, two economists, Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein, argue that the compulsory religious education of Jewish men transformed Jewish society from an agricultural to a commercial one during the first millennium and a half of the Common Era. Their approach is reminiscent of Sombart’s in two respects: it downplays persecution as an explanatory factor and stresses the persistence of Jewish cultural traits across time and space.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1289" href="#calibre_link-2009" class="calibre6">21</a>
</sup>
 In a recent essay, Adam Sutcliffe recounts the controversies surrounding the publication of <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 in 1911 and situates the work in the intellectual climate of the time but also urges us not to dismiss Sombart too easily, suggesting that he was neither “as straightforwardly hostile [to Jews] as many critics have assumed” nor “altogether wrong.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1290" href="#calibre_link-2010" class="calibre6">22</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">The partial rehabilitation of Sombart, whose “filtration with fascist ideology after World War I” was until recently deemed to have “irreparably tarnished his reputation,” is perplexing.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1291" href="#calibre_link-2011" class="calibre6">23</a>
</sup>
 If the goal is to revitalize interest in economic themes among scholars of past Jewish societies, Sombart is not the <span title="224" id="calibre_link-1678"></span>
 right starting point. <em class="calibre4">The Jews and Economic Life</em>
 should be read as a flawed empirical account and as a chapter in modern intellectual history, not as an imperfect model.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1292" href="#calibre_link-2012" class="calibre6">24</a>
</sup>
 Sombart’s insistence on the unusual economic occupational structure of most postexilic Jewish societies was nothing new at the time of its publication, and his explanations for this phenomenon were indefensible even by the standards of historical inquiry in his day.</p>
<p class="indent">Extreme as he was, Sombart was also the heir to a long tradition of referencing (more or less imaginary) Jews in order to make arguments for (and more often against) capitalism&mdash;to gloss once more the subtitle of Albert Hirschman’s influential work <em class="calibre4">The Passions and the Interests: Political Arguments for Capitalism Before Its Triumph</em>
 , this time putting the emphasis on <em class="calibre4">Arguments</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1293" href="#calibre_link-2013" class="calibre6">25</a>
</sup>
 This long tradition was already fading when Hirschman detected one of its traces. In 1977, his evocation of Montesquieu’s version of the legend of the Jewish invention of bills of exchange briefly revived positive receptions of that tale and incorporated it into an argument about the future of modern capitalism and democracy that was more uplifting than the one articulated by Sombart. But the reference to Montesquieu’s tale of Jewish inventiveness and survival fell on deaf ears, as the many readers of <em class="calibre4">The Passions and the Interests</em>
 did not recognize the legend’s complicated history and significance.</p>
<p class="indent">This example is indicative of a larger phenomenon: the decline in invocations of figures of Jews as forms of social and political critique. As I write these pages, antisemitism in the United States and especially in Europe is again on the rise, and insidious references to domineering Jewish capitalists&mdash;references that in some cases translate into hostile actions&mdash;are not confined to the fringes of media and society. Meanwhile, Islam has begun to provide another foil against which the West defines itself, primarily among the political Right, but even in sectors of the Left. Today as in the past, antisemitism and Islamophobia are neither mutually exclusive nor necessarily in competition with one another; in fact, they coexist in locally distinctive forms, particularly across parts of Europe, where images of Jews and Muslims are sometimes used interchangeably in debates about credibility, integrity, and civic loyalty.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1294" href="#calibre_link-2014" class="calibre6">26</a>
</sup>
 But if Hirschman’s reference to the legend of bills of exchange could be so easily disregarded, it is also because, thanks to meaningful changes in attitudes and to a new awareness of the power of language to cause harm, representations of Jews are no longer a preferred vehicle for mainstream Western culture, let alone scholars, to express their deepest worries and aspirations.</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, as this book has shown, that habit of mind was not only pervasive in the Middle Ages and at the height of racist antisemitism in modern <span title="225" id="calibre_link-1815"></span>
 Europe but also widespread in the post-Reformation period, that is, at the very time when European merchant culture is generally assumed to have begun to free itself from religious dictates. By establishing an intimate connection between Jews and bills of exchange, the legend did not censure all commercial pursuits. Rather, it reworked ingrained images of Jews as trickster lenders and disloyal subjects of Christian rulers who were capable of siphoning wealth out of the realm. In so doing, it projected onto imaginary figures generalized fears that the transformation of bills of exchange into both ordinary and incredibly complex operations made more and more acute in the course of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p class="indent">The putative Jewish invention of these bills became a way of addressing questions about the increasing abstraction of credit relations, the beneficial and corrupting consequences of their expansion, the limits of regulatory institutions, and even the nature of political power. Although not as autonomous from state financial policies as Bitcoins claim to be today, bills of exchange were primarily an instrument of private finance. They represented the ability of far-flung merchants to move funds, speculate on currency arbitrage, and potentially subvert states’ and empires’ monetary policies. In the 100 years before the French Revolution, they also became a fairly common form of payment among men and, to a lesser extent, women whose financial literacy was not always commensurate with the complexity of the speculative schemes into which they entered. During the nineteenth century, as new capitalist institutions from the factory to the corporation displaced commercial credit as the primary subjects of cultural and political struggle, the legend lost its immediacy as a moral tale and entered a new chapter of its existence as a pseudo-fact at the heart of influential accounts of the historical trajectory of Western capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many reasons why representations of Jews&mdash;and specifically of Jews’ alleged ways of handling money in the late Middle Ages&mdash;have had such an incredible pull on European authors of the most diverse dispositions and backgrounds. At bottom, all those representations have something in common: the assumption that historically, Jews behaved in the marketplace according to attributes that defined them outside of the marketplace. Not everyone agreed on what those attributes were and whether they were immutable or reformable. That is why we have encountered a plurality of representations of Jews and their economic roles, even if the most persistent was that of a devious Jewish usurer hiding behind an honest façade, ready to exploit credulous and upright Christian borrowers. The ubiquity of this image was a measure of <span title="226" id="calibre_link-1867"></span>
 the pull of the fantasy that market society, before and after it was called capitalism, might be constructed as a neutral zone, one unaffected by outside influences and where only those forces generated within market exchanges themselves meet and clash on a level playing field.</p>
<p class="indent">All the authors we have read and interrogated throughout this book wrestled with variations of the same question: How do legal, economic, and symbolic hierarchies that precede one’s entry into a financial transaction with someone from outside one’s immediate circle affect those transactions? By the seventeenth century, certain European governments had designed regimes of toleration that promised to treat Jewish merchants like all other merchants with regard to their trading and banking activities. Later, emancipation lifted all legal restrictions on Jewish men operating in the market. Different as these historical moments were, they both produced a more egalitarian structure within which Jewish economic actors could interact with non-Jews. Yet figures of Jews that owed more to long discursive traditions than to real-life struggles stripped even these more egalitarian forms of coexistence of their full meaning. That is why the ease with which Jews have been perceived as at once invisible and distinctive, marginal and yet centrally disruptive, ought to be part of how we understand the development of Western commercial society.</p>

<span class="small1">A SPECIALIST OF SIXTEENTH-CENTURY</span>
 western European merchants, the late Pierre Jeannin launched a laudable project at a time when historians still took notes on 6 × 8 index cards: an inventory of all economic treatises and manuals printed in Europe during the early modern period. Thanks to the collaboration of two colleagues, Jochen Hoock and Wolfgang Kaiser, the first volumes of this ongoing project have appeared, covering the period up to 1700. Jeannin and his collaborators titled their work <em class="calibre4">Ars Mercatoria</em>
 . By choosing a Latin expression, they gave the impression that they were using early modern terminology. In fact, they turned a rare expression into a staple phrase, at least among specialists. <em class="calibre4">Ars Mercatoria</em>
 , the art of commerce, is a felicitous title because it is capacious: it captures the amorphous boundaries of the literature it seeks to map in ways other modern terms, such as “economic treatises” or “manuals,” cannot.<sup class="calibre7">

 Bulky and only available in the traditional form of the bounded book, these volumes are an invaluable source: while expensive, their cost is not prohibitive; they are present in many libraries and can be ordered even by those with access only to interlibrary loan; and, most important of all, they list the library holdings of each bibliographical item. I have consulted them many times but could not rely on them alone in writing this book because at present they do not go beyond the year 1700.</p>
<p class="indent">Far smaller and partial, but also handier and more accessible, is the corpus of “economic bestsellers” published in Europe before 1800 redacted by Kenneth <span title="228" id="calibre_link-2082"></span>
 E. Carpenter, the former librarian of the Harvard Business School’s Kress Library of Business and Economics (now part of Baker Library). This list identifies forty titles of political economy, published between 1588 and 1848, primarily in English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian, on the basis of the estimated number of editions published in the original language and in translation. It is an eclectic list, one that begins with Bernardo Davanzati’s <em class="calibre4">Lezione delle monete</em>
 and ends with Karl Marx’s <em class="calibre4">Manifesto</em>
 , and excludes “practical works of the how-to-do-it” variety, such as Jacques Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Parfait négociant</em>
 .<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1296" href="#calibre_link-82" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
 I made little use of this catalogue because of the few titles it includes and its a priori division between high-and low-brow economic bestsellers. Sophus Reinert, by contrast, relied entirely on Carpenter’s corpus for his analysis of the canon of European political economy and its translation from one language to another; consequently, he also omitted the less canonical handbooks that I considered here.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1297" href="#calibre_link-83" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p class="indent">Given the focus of this book, I should mention one more traditional scholarly work: Jean-Claude Perrot’s pioneering essays on the economic literature published in Old Regime France. Perrot was the first to attempt to quantify the size of this phenomenon, although the basis for his calculations is not always clear.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1298" href="#calibre_link-84" class="calibre6">4</a>
</sup>
 Moreover, although he labeled his subject the study of “political economy,” a term coined in 1615 that gained currency in the following century, Perrot covered in detail texts such as Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Parfait négociant</em>
 and the Savary brothers’ <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire universel de commerce</em>
 , which fit neither the contemporary nor the modern definition of “political economy.”<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1299" href="#calibre_link-85" class="calibre6">5</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">The online database that best succeeds in embracing the wide assortment of publications available to early modern readers, ranging from price sheets to treatises of political economy, merchant manuals, commentaries on maritime law, and more, is <em class="calibre4">The Making of the Modern World</em>
 . This project began with the digitization of the two largest collections of printed material pertaining to all things economic from the invention of the printing press until the mid-nineteenth century: the Goldsmiths Library of Economic Literature at the University of London and the Kress Collection of Business and Economics at Harvard Business School. Since its creation, it has incorporated additional material from the Seligman Collection of the Butler Library at Columbia University and Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University. It is bound to expand further. As a result, multiple copies of the same title have sometimes been digitized.</p>
<p class="indent">The main advantage of this database is that it comes closest to capturing the definition of “the economy” as it existed in the minds of the readers and writers <span title="229" id="calibre_link-2083"></span>
 of the time. It does not exclude material by subject: everything from demography to trade, finance, agriculture, administration, and law comes under its purview. Nor does it make any formal or hierarchical distinctions between bound books, serial publications, pamphlets, or loose-leaf pages containing pieces of legislation, price lists, and more. Given the expansion of European commerce and colonial rule over this period, it also contains useful, if selective, information about other regions of the world. In short, it does not rely on a preestablished notion of what “the economy” meant at a given time, although its strengths reflect those of the library collections it uses and are thus tilted toward core areas of western Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The main drawback of this resource is its price. <em class="calibre4">The Making of the Modern World</em>

The company’s website shows that in 2015, out of a total of 166 institutional subscribers to at least one of the digital collections produced by Gale, 49 percent were in the United States and 24 percent in Japan. Across Europe there were only twenty-nine institutional subscribers (of which eight were in the United Kingdom and another eight in Switzerland).<sup class="calibre7">

<p class="indent">To combat the prohibitive costs of for-profit online resources, a number of libraries have partnered to produce open-access platforms that are more functional than Google Books. Particularly relevant to my work is the Hathi Trust Digital Library, which collects millions of digitized books, journals, and other materials (including pilot projects that extend to digital audio and image content, as well as digital-born publications). French rare book material can be accessed via Gallica, which makes available part of the digitized collections of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, even if it is rather clunky, and the Project for American and French Research on the Treasury of the French <span title="230" id="calibre_link-2084"></span>

<h2 class="chtitle2">The Legend’s Earliest Formulation</h2>
<p class="noindent">
<span class="small1">WHAT FOLLOWS IS MY</span>
 English translation of the text that forms the basis of the legend of the Jewish invention of marine insurance and bills of exchange as it appears in Étienne Cleirac’s 1661 <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 . I chose the second rather than the first (1647) edition of this book because it offers an extended version of the legend and because it circulated more widely than the first, as the number of surviving copies in rare book libraries attest. (Today, readers can access both editions online through Gallica.) Note that there exist two prints of the 1661 edition, both issued in Bordeaux, both with the same title and the same pagination. One version has a colored frontispiece and more decorations; it was printed “En la boutique de Millanges chez Guillaume Taupinard, marchand libraire.” The other has a black-and-white frontispiece and fewer decorations; it was printed “Par Iacques Mongiorn Millanges, imprimeur ordinaire du roy.”</p>
<p class="indent">I have underlined those words and sentences that do not appear in the 1647 edition and were added in 1661. I have retained italics, capital and small letters, and most of the punctuation as they figure in the original. I have chosen to stay as close to the text as possible except when a literal translation would be unintelligible.</p>

<p class="noindent">Chapter 1: On insurance contracts or policies, their definition, their similarities with and differences from other contracts pertaining to maritime affairs. First Article: <em class="calibre4">Insurance</em>
 is a contract through which one promises the indemnity of the goods that are transported from one country to another, especially when they are transported by sea; and it works by means of a price calculated as a percentage of the insured goods’ value and agreed upon between the insured, who carries the goods or has them transported by a third party, and the insurer, who promises the indemnity.</p>

 in order to retrieve their commodities and money, which they had consigned to or hidden in the hands of their friends before leaving, necessity taught these malicious men lacking public trust to use secret letters and bills written with few words and little substance, as bills of exchange still are, addressed to those who had received and concealed their stolen goods and given Jews a hand. Jews carried out these tasks by employing travelers and foreign merchants.</p>
<p class="indent">And having succeeded in this scheme, in order not to be deceived on the exchange rate, or in order to make a profit, they kept themselves informed <em class="calibre4">au pair &amp; à la touche</em>

 whose rates have always changed and varied in each province, much more in the past than at present; and this was the origin of bills of exchange, as <em class="calibre4">Villani</em>
 says.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to retrieve their movable goods, their commodities, and their other belongings in the Jewish fashion and to the risk and danger of those who performed that service for them, their mistrust suggested to them the invention of a rudimentary beginning of what became insurance certificates or policies, through which all the risks and dangers of a voyage fell onto those who had insured the goods, on condition that a gift or a modest price, which today is called <em class="calibre4">premium</em>
 , be paid; <u class="calibre11">it follows that bills of exchange and insurance policies are Jewish from birth, both in their invention and name</u>

 , meaning the followers of the Pope and the Emperor, respectively, threatened each other, so to endeavor to supplant one another and put Christianity through great troubles and tumult.</p>
<p class="indent">The weakest, or the most timid among each party, took refuge in those places that they estimated to be safest or most favorable, where, in order to survive in the absence of other professions, they practiced usury and these Jewish inventions. And in order to protect themselves from ecclesiastical censure, which has always condemned every sort of usury and usurers, they skillfully succeeded in having their practices recognized&mdash;not just tolerated by connivance, but recognized as highly necessary to the exercise and maintenance of commerce and traffic. <em class="calibre4">Usuram sub specie negotiationis palliantes</em>

<em class="calibre2">[Book 1] Chapter XIX: On the origin of bills of exchange and their commercial usefulness.</em>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before discussing bills of exchange and <em class="calibre4">billets de change</em>
 in detail,<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1354" href="#calibre_link-1900" class="calibre6">1</a>
</sup>
 it seems appropriate to examine their origin and the time period when their commerce began in France in order to satisfy the curiosity of those who do not know about these matters.</p>
<p class="indent">A thousand years ago no one in France knew what bills of exchange were; they were invented by the Jews who were expelled from France during the reigns of Dagobert I, Philip Augustus, and Philip the Tall, in the years 640, 1181, and 1316. They [the Jews] took refuge in Lombardy and in order to withdraw the money and the goods that they had left in France in the hands of their friends, necessity taught them to use letters and bills of very few words and little substance, as bills of exchange still are today, addressing those bills to their friends; and in order to carry out this task, they relied on travelers, pilgrims, and foreign merchants. Through this means they succeeded in retrieving all their assets, but because this sort of people has infinite genius for anything regarding gain and profit, they made every effort to acquire knowledge about the intrinsic value and possible impurities of all metallic currencies in <span title="244" id="calibre_link-2108"></span>
 order to make no mistakes in calculating the alloy of different coins, which at the time was highly volatile.</p>
<p class="indent">The Italian Lombards found the invention of bills of exchange to be very useful to cover up usury; and the Ghibellines who were exiled from Italy by the Guelph party, having settled in Amsterdam, followed the example of the Jews and [used] this instrument to retrieve the assets that they had in Italy and established the commerce of bills of exchange, which they called <em class="calibre4">polizza di cambio</em>
 . It was they who invented the re-exchange, when the bills that were sent to them came back protested and they pretended to be suffering losses, expenses, damage, and interest rates.</p>
<p class="indent">Merchants and traders found this invention very useful in order to facilitate their business in foreign countries, and because they derived considerable profits from these bills, they began to deal in these bills honestly. Princes and kings assisted them in this effort because the use of bills rendered superfluous the export of silver, diamonds, and precious stones out of their states for the purpose of buying merchandise, something that they always found important to prevent. For this reason princes and kings granted ample privileges to these merchants, designating squares and other public spaces to the conduct of exchange dealings. Still today the square in Amsterdam is called <em class="calibre4">Lombard square</em>
 owing to the fact that the Ghibellines gathered there in order to carry out their exchange dealings.</p>
<p class="indent">The merchants of Amsterdam spread the commerce of bills of exchange all over Europe, and particularly in France, through their correspondents; as a result our kings conceded ample privileges to merchants, especially to those in Lyon, where it seems that the commerce of bills of exchange began. These privileges gave rise to the establishment of the jurisdiction that in that city is called <em class="calibre4">Conservation</em>
 and the jurisdiction known as <em class="calibre4">Consulaire</em>
 , which was created by Charles IX in 1563 and which is now established in all the cities of the kingdom where commerce is considerable, so that all disputes between merchants and traders over bills of exchange and other commercial matters<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1355" href="#calibre_link-1901" class="calibre6">2</a>
</sup>
 be adjudicated on the spot, without any legal formalities except for the simple issuing of a libel, and without recourse to lawyers or other legal intermediaries.<sup class="calibre7">
<a id="calibre_link-1356" href="#calibre_link-1902" class="calibre6">3</a>
</sup>
 The hope is that in this manner justice be provided free of charge and by judges who are chosen from among merchants and traders for their knowledge of all matters concerning commodities and bills of exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">It is certain that there is nothing more useful to the state and to the public than the use of bills of exchange. But it should also be admitted that there is <span title="245" id="calibre_link-2109"></span>
 nothing more dangerous than this commerce, which produces more usury and bankrupts when bankers, merchants, and traders practice it with lust and imprudence. Moreover, merchants ought to keep good records of their business in order to know its condition quickly and at any time. Because banking is an activity practiced by bankers and merchants of all the cities in the kingdom [of France] where manufactures are established, and is usually conducted in cooperation with foreigners, bills of exchange are of utmost necessity for the maintenance of commerce and in order to receive or pay the sums of money that bankers, merchants, and traders draw on each other and remit reciprocally for the purchase and sale of their merchandise; even for matters others than commerce, bills of exchange are very useful to the state and the public.</p>
<p class="indent">The etymology of the word “bill of exchange” is easily understood: it means nothing else than to convert the money that a merchant has in one city and sends it to be received in another city by a merchant who has a stable business there and has available a similar sum, which he gives in exchange in the city where he resides, from where the bill is drawn. This exchange is equally advantageous to both parties because the one who will have the money in a city without this convenience would otherwise be obliged to make the money come in specie through couriers and chariots and the one who would need it in the same city to conduct his business would otherwise be obliged to transport it from the place of his residence.</p>
<p class="indent">The word “exchange” also derives from the fact that the profit or interest that is received and the one that is produced when a bill is drawn or remitted are never the same: the profit can be high or low; sometimes there is a loss, other times a gain; occasionally the exchange is even, that is, there is nothing to lose or to gain among those involved in these exchange dealings: the commerce of bills of exchange gives rise to a perpetual transformation.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to stress that different exchange rates from one country to the other are what determines the currency conversions. For instance, if a merchant wants to remit to Amsterdam one écu of France currency that is worth 3 livres, he won’t receive more than 96 deniers de gros, which are worth 48 sols (presuming that the exchange is at this rate because it always fluctuates, as I said above); because 120 gros make one écu, which are 3 livres in France, it follows that the merchant will lose 12 solds per écu, or 20%, in the exchange. This loss is to be attributed to the fact that the currency is weaker in Holland than in France: the same happens with issuances and remittances to and from <span title="246" id="calibre_link-2110"></span>
 foreign countries where the currency is weaker than in France. Indeed, if all currencies were valued at the same rate as in France in every European state, all exchange would be equal: that is, a merchant would give one golden Louis in a French city in order to receive another currency of equivalent value in a foreign location. In that case, there would be neither loss nor gain for either party, and all gains or losses in the exchange dealings would result from the abundance or scarcity of money in the places where issuances and remittances would be carried out. For example, in France, where all moneys have the same exchange rate, if the Parisian money market only needed 1,000,000 to pay what it owed in Lyon for its payments of the month of August, and if the Lyon money market also only needed 1,000,000 in Paris, the exchange would even itself out because both cities had the same need; by contrast, if Paris needed 1,500,000 livres to pay in Lyon at the time of the aforementioned payments, while Lyon only needed 1,000,000 in Paris, bills of exchange would be rare, and the money paid in Paris in order to draw bills in Lyon would be devalued, and bills would appreciate; and if the abundance of money were in Paris and the scarcity in Lyon, the bills would lose in value and money would appreciate in value.</p>
<p class="indent">The usefulness that merchants found in the commerce of bills of exchange gave rise to the so-called <em class="calibre4">billets de change</em>
 , delivered or deliverable, payable to the order or to the bearer, which greatly facilitate payments and do not oblige [merchants] to keep all their money idly in the cashier without the possibility of generating any gains, as well as other bills that are considered as money that were lent or merchandise that was sold, payable to the order or to the bearer, which are a class of credit instruments different from simple bills with value of money or merchandise.</p>
<p class="indent">I will explain in the following chapters the many types of bills of exchange and the endorsements that we write on their back. Regarding the different types of trade handled with these bills, I will also discuss the duration of the credit; whether it expires on a certain date or after a standard period (<em class="calibre4">at usance</em>
 ); a bill’s acceptance, whether it is oral or written; how bills were practiced before the <em class="calibre4">Ordonnance</em>
 of March 1673; how protests work; and what diligence should be undertaken to avoid not being able to bring exchanges to a good end. I will also explain all sorts of bills, whether bills of exchange or other types, with the diligences that should be undertaken in case of default according to the <em class="calibre4">Ordonnance</em>
 ; and I will give the formulas in which these instruments should be written in order to avoid the risk that they be annulled for not following <span title="247" id="calibre_link-2111"></span>
 the form prescribed by the <em class="calibre4">Ordonnance</em>
 . I do so in the hope that merchants’ factors and commission agents will learn all these differences and acquire the skill to carry out this business, in the service of their principals or of themselves when they will practice this commerce on their own.</p>

Ouvrage posthume du Sieur Jacques Savary des Bruslons ... Continué sur les memoires de l’auteur, et donné au public par M. Philemon Louis Savary</em>

<p class="indent">Insurance: … The origins of insurance come from the Jews: they were its inventors, when they were expelled from France in 1182 during the reign of Philip Augustus. They used insurance to facilitate the transport of their assets. They used it again in 1321, under King Philip the Tall, when they were once again expelled from the Kingdom.</p>
<p class="indent">Bills of exchange: … Bills of exchange were unknown to ancient Roman jurisprudence: according to the prevalent opinion, they were invented by Jews, who, after being banned from France for the horrible crimes of which they were accused, and having found refuge in Lombardy during the reigns of Philip Augustus in 1181 and Philip the Tall in 1316, found the way of salvaging the assets that they had left in their friends’ hands through the use of secret letters and notes drafted in short and precise terms, as bills of exchange still are today, and did so through the intervention of travelers and foreign merchants.</p>
<p class="indent">After being expelled from Italy by the Guelph party, the Ghibellines, having reached Amsterdam, used the same instruments as the Jews in order to retrieve the goods that they had been forced to leave behind in Italy; it therefore seems plausible that it was them [the Ghibellines] who instilled the first knowledge of bills of exchange into the minds of Amsterdam’s traders and merchants, who have since spread it across Europe with the sole goal of making their own commerce easier.</p>
<p class="indent">It is maintained that those very same Ghibellines also invented the re-exchange, to account for their losses and interests in those instances when bills of exchange (which they called <em class="calibre4">polizze di cambio</em>
 ) were not cashed and were sent back via a protest.</p>
<p class="indent"><span title="248" id="calibre_link-2113"></span>
 Others maintain that merchants from Lyon were the first to circulate bills of exchange in France as a result of the considerable trading relations that they had with merchants from Amsterdam and Italy.</p>
<p class="indent">Bills of exchange are of great utility in commerce as long as merchants do no commit any abuses and that the exchange is real, especially because thanks to these bills it is possible to receive money everywhere one needs it without any trouble and without any risk. It is more or less certain that without the aid of these bills, commerce and all forms of business would languish.</p>

 . Throughout the book, I purposefully avoid the casual use of the term <em class="calibre4">capitalism</em>
 , in spite of the new purchase it has acquired since 2008 and, especially, since the publication of Thomas Piketty’s <em class="calibre4">Capital in the Twenty-first Century</em>
 , trans. Arthur Goldhammer (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2014 [2013]). I fear that to call the money markets of premodern Europe capitalistic would interfere with my quest to identify their specificities and link them to the cultural clashes that they generated. Consequently, in referring to the economy of the late medieval and early modern periods, I often resort to the label <em class="calibre4">preindustrial</em>
 because structural conditions that affected the working of credit markets, notably poor information technologies and the absence of notions of legal and political equality, can be found throughout the history of Europe from 1000 to 1800. Only in <a href="#calibre_link-137" class="calibre6">chapter 7</a>
 do I readily use the term <em class="calibre4">capitalism</em>
 , because there I engage with nineteenth-and early-twentieth-century social theories aimed at defining modern capitalism as a distinctive historical phenomenon.</p>

 . Building on the work of others and on his own interpretation of Iberian history, David Nirenberg has made the case that the events of 1391 provoked a crisis in European culture that had even graver repercussions than the expulsion ordered in 1492.

 . The Deputies of Commerce asked that tax farmers and state financiers be allowed to accept bills of exchange drawn on Paris by merchants in Bordeaux and other areas as payments of their dues but prohibited from drawing their bills of exchange out of the kingdom, since that would harm the state. The request appealed to a protectionist stance averse to the export of specie that royal officials were likely to be sympathetic to.

 . The idea of a “posthumous invention” is obviously incongruous. The author probably meant to stress the longevity of that invention, but thus goes baroque prose. Estienne Cleirac, <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer, divisées en trois parties: I. De la navigation. II. Du commerce naval &amp; contracts maritimes. III.

 (Bordeaux: Iacques Mongiron Millanges, 1661), 218. Since the 1661 edition of this book is far more easily accessible than the 1647 one, from here on out, I will give the page numbers from both editions, which I will refer to as <em class="calibre4">UCM 1647</em>

<a id="calibre_link-2" href="#calibre_link-523" class="calibre6">2</a>
 . The choice of the word <em class="calibre4">legend</em>
 requires a brief explanation, because the term does not appear in any of the texts that I examine. By most definitions, a legend, unlike a myth, has human rather than supernatural protagonists and is anchored in a kernel of historical truth. See William Harmon and C. Hugh Holmans, <em class="calibre4">A Handbook to Literature</em>
 , 7th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1996), 288, s.v. “legend”; and M. H. Abrams, <em class="calibre4">A Glossary of Literary Terms</em>
 , 7th ed. (Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1999), 170, s.v. “myth.” The narrative I analyze here fits the definition of a legend insofar as it derives its purchase, at least in part, from its supposed historical setting. In another respect, however, it departs from legends’ tendency to pivot on an individual rather than a collective: Karl Beckson and Arthur Ganz, <em class="calibre4">Literary Terms: A Dictionary</em>
 , rev. ed. (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1975), 127&ndash;128, s.v. “legend.” I occasionally also use the term <em class="calibre4">tale</em>
 in place of <em class="calibre4">legend</em>
 , since both describe an invented tradition. I am grateful to Diana Fuss for a stimulating discussion in this regard.</p>
<p class="note">
<a id="calibre_link-5" href="#calibre_link-524" class="calibre6">3</a>
 . I say “loosely indebted” for several reasons: practitioners of symptomatic reading, an approach that reached its height in the 1980s and 1990s, were influenced by deconstruction, Marxism, and psychoanalysis to an extent that I am not; more generally, symptomatic reading has been applied to high-brow literature and thus to self-reflexive writing rather than to texts that, <span title="299" id="calibre_link-2167"></span>
 for the most part, have normative and practical purposes, such as legal commentaries or merchant handbooks.

 . The sea loan (<em class="calibre4">foenus nauticum</em>

The product of multiple revisions and redactions, these ancient <em class="calibre4">coutumiers</em>
 formed the object of intense study in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when they became a bone of contention in the monarchy’s efforts to expand its legal and jurisdictional authority at the expense of seigniorial rights.

 . For Ambrose, all usury is theft. Chapter 3 of his <em class="calibre4">De Tobia</em>
 , cited by Cleirac, ends with a strong and often-cited tirade about what today we would call predatory lending: “He pays usury who lacks food. Is there anything more terrible? He asks for medicine, you offer him poison; he begs for bread, you offer him a sward; he begs for liberty, you impose slavery; he prays for freedom, you tighten the knot of the hideous snare.” Lois Miles Zucker, ed., <em class="calibre4">S.

Contemporary interpreters and modern scholars are divided over how to interpret the meaning of “excessive interest.” Some insist that the church refused to put a price on usury, if nothing else, to retain its free hand: McLaughlin, “Teaching of the Canonists” (1939), 99; Benjamin N. Nelson, <em class="calibre4">The Idea of Usury: From Tribal Brotherhood to Universal Otherhood</em>
 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1949), 16&ndash;18.

 , trans. Miriam Kochan (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1977 [1965]), 24.

 . To add rhetorical force to this passage, the second edition of <em class="calibre4">Us et coustumes de la mer</em>
 includes a long list of terms in Old French that describe those who cheat, a group that Dante condemns to inhale sulfide in the same circle of the <em class="calibre4">Inferno</em>

 continued to appear in French dictionaries of the nineteenth century with the meaning of usurer: e.g., Émile Littré, <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire de la langue française</em>

 . Starting in 1597, the city of Amsterdam issued compilations of local customs to be applied in commercial and maritime disputes, including the Laws of Visby, the Customs of Antwerp, ordinances issued by Charles V and Philip II, and procedural norms. Judging from the number of expanded editions that were subsequently issued, these publications enjoyed a large reader-ship, but they were also more local in their purview than Cleirac’s work.

 were reissued frequently in the sixteenth century, an indication of the growing challenges to them, as least in some locales. A royal decree of 1560 forbade all noblemen or legal officials from engaging in any trade at the risk of losing their titles and suffering the imposition of the chief direct tax (<em class="calibre4">taille</em>

 of Brittany allowed noblemen to become judges and lawyers: Isambert, <em class="calibre4">Recueil général</em>

In 1701, the same prerogative was extended to all noblemen who were not magistrates and who engaged in wholesale trade, whether overseas or overland (20:400&ndash;402). That the 1701 provision had to be repeated in 1727 suggests that its implementation was not without resistance (21:306). See also Kessler, “ ‘Question of Name,’” 62n12.</p>

 . In addition to the general contours of the story, specific textual comparisons suggest that Montesquieu consulted the work of fellow Bordelais Étienne Cleirac and Jacques Savary, even if neither appears in his library’s catalogue: Louis Desgraves, Catherine Volpilhac-Auger, and Françoise Weil, <em class="calibre4">Catalogue de la bibliothèque de Montesquieu à la Brède</em>

 (accessed July 9, 2018). The <span title="345" id="calibre_link-2218"></span>
 expression “secret letters,” in Montesquieu’s footnote, appeared in Cleirac but not in Savary’s <em class="calibre4">Parfait négociant</em>
 , which spoke of “letters and bills of very few words and little substance,” although it also figures in the Savarys’ <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire</em>
 ” (appendix 4). Other textual and contextual clues suggest that Montesquieu likely knew Cleirac’s work. Another comment in <em class="calibre4">The Spirit of the Laws</em>
 (XXI, 17) concerning the ancient Roman law of wreck appears to be derivative of Cleirac (chapter 4, <a href="#calibre_link-924" class="calibre6">note 38</a>
 ). Note that Montesquieu commended the usefulness of marine insurance to sustain seafaring trade but still called it “maritime usury” (XXII, 20), a telling linguistic relic of a medieval past that Cleirac perceived as proximate.</p>

 . For Hirschman (<em class="calibre4">Passions and the Interests</em>
 , 58), “the evaluation of commerce and money-making pursuits as harmless and innocuous can be understood as an indirect consequence of the long-dominant aristocratic ideal.” By contrast, for Robert Boesche, Montesquieu maintained an aristocratic disdain for commerce that he justified theoretically by stressing not only the self-restraint that commerce could generate but also “the self-interest, luxury, and license that seemed to be the inseparable companions of the new commercial classes”: Boesche, “Fearing Monarchs and Merchants: Montesquieu’s Two Theories of Despotism,” <em class="calibre4">Political Research Quarterly</em>

 , ed. Christiane Mervaud, in <em class="calibre4">The Complete Works of Voltaire</em>
 , 143 vols., ed. Theodore Besterman (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1994), vols. 35&ndash;36. That is because no such entry appeared in the first clandestine publication of <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire philosophique portatif</em>
 in 1764 or in the revised versions issued through 1769, although there were numerous mentions of Jews throughout these texts. However, in 1756 Voltaire had published an essay titled “De Juifs” in the <em class="calibre4">Mélanges de littérature, d’histoire et de philosophie</em>
 . This is the text that inspired a rebuttal by the Amsterdam Jewish writer Isaac de Pinto (see chapter 7, <a href="#calibre_link-957" class="calibre6">note 126</a>
 ). Some early editions of Voltaire’s complete works reproduced the 1756 essay: e.g., <em class="calibre4">Collection complette des œvres de Mr. de Voltaire</em>
 , 5 vols., new ed. (n.p.: n.p., 1772), 5:5&ndash;22. It was also included in the earliest English translation of his works: <em class="calibre4">The Works of M. de Voltaire</em>

 , 45B:79&ndash;138. More importantly for us, the 1756 essay became the first of the four sections that made up an extended spurious entry titled “Juifs” that figured in many versions of the <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire philosophique</em>
 from the 1780s onward. The passage lifted from Jaucourt’s entry in the <em class="calibre4">Encyclopédie</em>
 was cited in the third section of this expanded entry, which was assembled on the basis of Voltaire’s sparse notes: e.g., <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire philosophique</em>
 , in <em class="calibre4">Oevres completes de Voltaire</em>
 , 70 vols. (Paris: Société littéraire-typographique, 1784&ndash;1789), 41:136&ndash;182, at 158; Voltaire, <em class="calibre4">Dictionnaire philosophique</em>

 , 52 vols., new ed. (Paris: Garnier frères, 1877&ndash;1885), 19:511&ndash;541, at 526. The expanded entry concluded by exhorting Jews to make the most of their superior skills in matters of commerce and to take them back to Palestine. In his <em class="calibre4">Histoire générale</em>
 , Voltaire exploited the cliché of Jews’ commercial dexterity in order to lament their excessive influence on the Spanish economy and to decry the “proud idleness” of Polish noblemen who left commerce in the hands of <span title="349" id="calibre_link-2222"></span>

Mendelssohn later took issue with Dohm’s negative portrait of the Jews’ involvement in commerce. In the preface to his German translation of Menasseh ben Israel’s 1655 call for the readmission of Jews to England, Mendelssohn posited a stronger link between economic and civic freedom, and advocated “civic acceptance” (<em class="calibre4">bürgerliche Aufnahme</em>

Before Hourwitz’s defense, a young and vocal leader of the Metz Jewish community, Isaïe Berr-Bing (1759&ndash;1805), rebutted a libel written by an infantry captain, Philippe-Francois de Latour-Foissac, who portrayed Jews as insatiably hungry for gold, nourished by hatred for gentiles, and incapable of feeling pity for others because of their “greed” and “scandalous commerce”: Latour-Foissac, <em class="calibre4">Le cri du citoyen contre les Juifs de Metz par un capitaine d’infanterie</em>

A lone dissenting voice is Gérard Nahon’s analysis of Jewish advocacy in Paris, which emphasizes the commonality of the cause advanced by the Jews of southwestern and northeastern France and Paris: Nahon, “Séfarades et ashkenazes en France: La conquête de l’emancipation (1789&ndash;1791),” in <em class="calibre4">Les Juifs dans l’histoire de France</em>
 , ed. Myriam Yardeni (Leiden: Brill, 1980), 9&ndash;145.

 . Languages and sovereign states were not homologous in the eighteenth century but were beginning to converge. In appendices 5 and 6, I use language (rather than place of publication or author’s birthplace) as the ordering criterion of all printed volumes in which the legend appeared. At least two important works were written in French by non-French authors (Bielfeld <span title="359" id="calibre_link-2233"></span>
 and Beausobre). I discuss them in this chapter, rather than in the previous one, which is devoted to eighteenth-century French thought. Samuel Ricard, by contrast, is discussed in chapter 4 and only referenced in passing here, although his treatise in French was printed in Amsterdam. While somewhat arbitary, these choices were made with the twin purpose of appreciating the legend’s dissemination and outlining its local declensions. Obviously, there was no country in Europe at this time where Latin was a spoken language. Needless to say, neither appendix is exhaustive.</p>

 . Neither the corpus known as <em class="calibre4">Ars mercatoria</em>
 nor Kenneth E. Carpenter’s “The Economic Bestsellers Before 1850” (both described in appendix 1) are helpful: the former ends in 1700, while the inadequacy of the latter as a point of reference is confirmed by the cross-references in appendix 6. Note that appendix 6 only lists the earliest edition of any text in which the legend is mentioned. In the Dutch case, the vehicle of the story was a single merchant manual that was reprinted multiple times. In one interpretation, early modern economic writing was scarcer in commercially vibrant countries, such as the Venetian and Dutch republics, than in countries like France, which sought to imitate their more commercially successful rivals: Étienne Laspeyres, <em class="calibre4">Geschichte der volkswirthschaftlichen Anschauungen der Niederländer und ihrer Litteratur zur Zeit der Republik</em>

 . I have not encountered figures of Jews in the heated debates surrounding the Great Re-coinage crisis of 1696, which concerned the metallic value of English money rather than the intangible quality of paper credit instruments. Rhetorical appeals to Jews became more frequent after the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720. An anonymous pamphlet published soon after the creation of the Bank of England decried unsavory practices involving the stock market and the public debt but made no mention of Jews: <em class="calibre4">Angliae Tutamen: or, The Safety of England, Being an Account of the Banks, Lotteries, Mines, Diving, Draining, Lifting, and Other Engines, and Many Pernicious Projects Now on Foot; Tending to the Destruction of Trade and Commerce, and the Impoverishing This Realm</em>

 ). His discussion of bills of exchange was part of an argument, borrowed from French physiocrats, in favor of liberalizing the grain trade in Tuscany. Together with this text, Pagnini also published a new edition of two key merchant manuals from the late Middle Ages: Francesco Balducci Pegolotti’s <em class="calibre4">La pratica della mercatura</em>
 (c. 1340) and Giovanni di Antonio da Uzzano’s <em class="calibre4">La pratica della mercatura</em>
 (1442). In those two manuals, between which Pagnini failed to draw explicit comparisons, bills of exchange were the exclusive province of Christian international bankers, untainted by the operations of Jewish pawnbrokers.</p>

 (Braunschweig: C. A. Schwetschke und sohn, 1866). In 1875 Roscher’s essay appeared in both German and Italian: “Die Stellung der Juden im Mittelalter, betrachtet vom Standpunkte der allgemeinen Handelspolitik,” <em class="calibre4">Zeitschrift für die gesammte Staatswissenschaft</em>
 31 (1875): 503&ndash;526; “La situazione degli ebrei nel Medio Evo considerata dal punto di vista della generale politica commerciale,” <em class="calibre4">Giornale degli economisti</em>
 1, no. 2 (1875): 87&ndash;109. The English version, from which I cite, appeared much later and omitted the last section of the essay, in which Roscher outlined an embryonic comparative approach, putting Jews alongside other minorities devoted to niche commercial activities. It was published during World War II by Guido Kisch, a Czech-born Jewish scholar of medieval Jews for whom Roscher’s piece demonstrated the integration of Jews into German <span title="377" id="calibre_link-2252"></span>
 society (another reason why he did not care to include in the translation the section dedicated to non-Jewish middleman minorities). Other scholars, by contrast, described Roscher as “the grandfather of Nazi Jewish science” for his “folk-psychological theories” of Jews’ economic roles and stressed that Heinrich von Trietschke, one of Sombart’s teachers, easily reconciled Roscher’s thesis with his own rabid antisemitism: Toni Oelsner, “William Roscher’s Theory of the Economic and Social Position of the Jews in the Middle Ages,” <em class="calibre4">YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Science</em>

The petition that Sombart cited in support of his hypothesis was addressed to the Senate in 1550 by Christian merchants who had extensive credit relations with crypto-Jews and feared losing their business if the republic went ahead with its plan to expel the latter. The petition cited by Sombart simply stated that its signatories used bills of exchange in trading with crypto-Jews (“Il medesimo comertio tegniamo con loro etiam in materia di cambia, perché ne rimettano continuamente i loro denari”): David Kaufman, “Die Vertreibung der Marranen aus Venedig im Jahre 1550,” <em class="calibre4">Jewish Quarterly Review</em>

 (Bordeaux: Charles Lefebvre, 1875), 35&ndash;36, a book that Sombart cited six times. But for reasons that should be obvious, Sombart did not embrace Montesquieu’s version of the legend.</p>

 Isidore Loeb, “Rôle social des Juifs,” <em class="calibre4">Revue des études juives</em>

Two learned studies, one by the Orthodox rabbi Moses Hoffmann (which Sombart cited) and one by Bruno Hahn (which may have appeared too late to be incorporated into Sombart’s volume), challenged Roscher by showing that he had overestimated the scope of Jews’ commercial activities in the period before the Crusades: Hoffmann, <em class="calibre4">Der Geldhandel der deutschen Juden während des Mittelalters bis zum Jahre 1350</em>

 history of Jews from antiquity to the Middle Ages. A leftist Zionist, he downplayed religion more than Graetz and Caro, but, like them, he stressed oppression as the key factor in funneling Jews into trade. While embracing Roscher’s thesis of Jews’ turn to moneylending in the late Middle Ages, he highlighted the occupational diversity of all Jewish societies and the many instances in which Jews were employed in agriculture rather than international trade: Schipper, <em class="calibre4">Anfänge des Kapitalismus bei den abendländischen Juden im früheren Mittelalter</em>
 (Wien and Leipzig: Wilhelm Branmuller, 1907). Characteristically, Sombart did not contend with Schipper’s thesis but only quoted his book to say that “in the later Middle Ages the Jews were wealthy” and to sprinkle his narrative with one more anecdote: Sombart, <em class="calibre4">Jews and Modern Capitalism</em>
 , 296, 317, 397n544, 399n571, 400n572. Schipper responded by challenging Sombart’s notions that Judaism as a religion was conducive to capitalism and that Jews possessed a “predisposition” (<em class="calibre4">Urveranlagung</em>
 ) to it. He was particularly critical of Sombart for depicting the Jews as a socially and economically homogeneous group and failing to discuss the relationship between Jewish “patrician” families and Jewish society at large: Schipper, “Der jüdische Kapitalismus (zur Sombart-Brentano-Kontroverse),” <em class="calibre4">Der Jude: Eine Monatsschrift</em>
 1&ndash;2 (1918): 130&ndash;137. Other German historians also took Sombart to task for his overblown statements about Jews’ economic influence: Felix Rachfahl, “Das Judentum und die Genesis des modernen Kapitalismus,” <em class="calibre4">Preussischer Jahrbücher</em>

 ) but also stressed the need for more thorough studies of rabbinic texts to illuminate this and related topics: Zunz, “Etwas über die rabbinische Literatur: Nebst Nachrichten über ein altes bis jezt ungedrucktes hebräisches Werk,” in <em class="calibre4">Gesammelte Schriften</em>
 (Berlin: Louis Gerschel Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1875), 3&ndash;31, at 15.

 , 7&ndash;8, also singled out those mistakes. Julius Guttmann (1880&ndash;1950), later a professor of Jewish philosophy at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, questioned Sombart’s understanding of rabbinics, including the sixteenth-century legal code composed by Yosef Caro, <em class="calibre4">Shulhan Arukh</em>

 (Florence: G. Pellas, 1869), 8. Arturo Segre explicitly denied that either Jews expelled from France by King Dagobert I or Florentine exiles to France could have invented bills of exchange and insisted instead on the slow evolution of the contract, pointing to Muslim merchants in tenth-century Sicily as possible precursors: Segre, <em class="calibre4">Manuale di storia del commercio</em>

Fanfani was influenced by Giuseppe Toniolo (1845&ndash;1918), the leading theorist of the Catholic social doctrine that sought to offer an alternative to both liberalism and socialism, with whom Sombart had studied during a brief stay in Pisa in 1883.

Armando Sapori did not identify as a Catholic, and his work focused more on Italian medieval merchants’ business techniques than spiritual life, but he too assumed a synthesis between early capitalism and Christian morality.

 : Come siamo a casa, credo ch’io non ritrovarò de l’uova, che porti in quel cesto un solo intiero. Ma con chi parlo io? Dove diavolo è rimasto ancora questo ghiotto? Sarà restato a dar la caccia a qualche cane o a scherzare con l’orso. A ogni cosa che truova per via, si ferma: se vede facchino o villano o giudeo, non lo terrieno le catene che non gli andasse a fare qualche dispiacere. Tu verrai pure una volta, capestro: bisogna che di passo in passo ti vadi aspettando. Per Dio, s’io truovo pure un solo di quelle uova rotte, ti romperò la testa.” In this passage Dolio, a cook, complains that his young assistant is distracted by anything he encounters in the street&mdash; whether a porter, a peasant, or a Jew&mdash;and warns him against breaking any of the eggs he is carrying. The gist of the story is that the servant takes it for granted that Jews are among those who can be harassed in the street. It should also be noted that in several of his comedies, including <em class="calibre4">La Lena</em>
 , Ariosto satirized the worship of money in contemporary society.</p>

 . Since at least the fourteenth century, the word “cahorsin” or “caursin” had meant a usurer. Cleirac invokes a common etymology by which the word meant “an inhabitant of Cahors,” a small town in southern France whose merchants and bankers were apparently ill reputed for their moneylending practices. The thirteenth-century English monk Matthew Paris, whose work Cleirac cites repeatedly, suggested an alternative etymology, noting that “Caursines” may derive from “<em class="calibre4">causor</em>
 , to cheat, or <em class="calibre4">capio</em>
 , to take, and <em class="calibre4">ursine</em>
 , bearish.” <em class="calibre4">Matthew Paris’s English History</em>

 to denote a usurer is found in Boccaccio, <em class="calibre4">Esposizioni sopra la Comedia di Dante</em>
 (1373&ndash;1374), ch. XI, par. 39, cited in <em class="calibre4">Tesoro della lingua Italian dalle origini</em>
 , s.v. “caorsino” (<a href="http://tlio.ovi.cnr.it/TLIO/" class="calibre6">http//tlio.ovi.cnr.it/TLIO/</a>
 ). The word continued to appear in French dictionaries of the nineteenth century: e.g., <em class="calibre4">Émile Littré: Dictionnaire de la langue française</em>
 (1872&ndash;1877), s.v. “corsi.” But a full-text keyword search for “ca(h)orsin/s” in <em class="calibre4">The Making of the Modern World</em>
